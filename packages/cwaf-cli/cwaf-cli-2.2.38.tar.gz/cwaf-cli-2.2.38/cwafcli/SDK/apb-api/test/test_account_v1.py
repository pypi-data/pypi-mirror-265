    Advanced Bot Protection API

    This is the API for onboarding websites into Advanced Bot Protection. For full feature documentation, see [Advanced Bot Protection](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/advanced-bot-protection/page/74791.htm)  ## Terminology differences  The API term *Domain* corresponds to, and is interchangeable with, a *Website* as used in the UI and web based documentation.  The API term *Site* corresponds to and is interchangeable with a *Website Group* as used in the UI and web based documentation.  The API term *Selector* corresponds to and is interchangeable with a *per-Path* *Policy* as used in the UI and web based documentation.  Besides the Imperva *account*, there is also an Advanced Bot Protection *account*. The are connected but have their own identifiers that cannot be mixed. In the API, *account* always refers to an ABP account unless otherwise specified.  ## Updates  When using PUT to update a resource, the entire resource will be replaced and any omitted fields may be deleted. To prevent data loss when performing an update you must GET the resource, update the returned response, and then send the result as the PUT request body.  ## API compatibility  Previous versions of the API are deprecated when a new version is released. Previous versions will be supported until further notice.  For a client to stay compatible with non breaking changes they need to take the following into account:  * New optional properties and properties with default values may   be added to JSON objects used as API request bodies.  * New properties may be added to JSON objects in API response bodies.  * Certain sum types (e.g. `enum` and `oneOf`) are documented as *open*   which means new alternatives can be added. The new values will only   be present if configured using the API or UI.  ## Authentication  See [API Key Management](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/cloud-application-security/page/settings/api-keys.htm) for instructions on how to authenticate to this API.  ## Pagination  Resources may be paginated. This is indicated by the inclusion of the 'next' and/or the 'prev' relations in the '_links' property. See the Links schema documentation.   # noqa: E501
