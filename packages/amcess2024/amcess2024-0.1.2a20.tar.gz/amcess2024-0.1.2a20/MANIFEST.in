## ------------------------------------
## Removing files from the distribution
##
## Setuptools is pretty good about excluding appropriate bits, but you may need to
## remove files that were added in the commands above

global-exclude \
  *.py[co] \          # Only required if including files / grafting trees that may contain bytecode.
  .DS_Store \

prune **/__pycache__  # Same as *.py[co] above.
prune docs/build
