# PII Masking Project

## Overview
The PII Masking Project is designed to automatically detect and mask Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, emails, organizations, and phone numbers from text documents. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, this tool ensures that sensitive information is protected, making it ideal for privacy-conscious industries and applications.

## Features
- **Automatic Detection**: Accurately identifies various types of PII in unstructured text.
- **Customizable Masking**: Offers customizable options for masking detected PII, such as replacement with generic placeholders or redaction.
- **Supports Multiple Formats**: Capable of processing plain text, PDFs, and other popular document formats (additional configurations may be required).
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes large volumes of text, suitable for enterprise-scale applications.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into existing workflows or systems.

## Installation

Before installation, ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system.
