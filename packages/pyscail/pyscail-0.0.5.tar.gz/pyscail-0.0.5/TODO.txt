Primary stuff

X make a rough draft of how pyscail should work
X make run just the basic mandelbrot program on pyscail
X run the julia set program on pyscail by generalizing
X generalize further; run Conway's game of life
  X Write the grid kernel utilities
X Make the more beautiful mandelbrot/julia; 
X Refactor globals
X Refactor settings and setting-related constants
X generalize to the most general form I can imagine
X make ONE more example for pyscail, maybe
  X wireworld
  X Belusov-Zhabotinsky reaction
  X Langton's ant

Packaging and modularizing
- follow the instructions and package up the project
- move the demos stuff to where it needs to be
- fix README


Secondary stuff/stuff to do when submitting the application

- Document it (how to use it?) and have a video demonstration in the README
- handle input
- Have examples that are executable using pyscail
- Check the older examples for backwards compatibility
- Write tests
- Document dependencies; make a requirements.txt
- Type system stuff; use type hints? Refactor to use inheritance?
