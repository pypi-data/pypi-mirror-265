def parse_assignments(assignment_strs: Sequence[str]):
    """
    This parses a list of assignment strings. The assignments are supposed to be given in the following form:

    'NEW_VAR = f(Parent_1, ..., Parent_n, N), N ~ DISTRIBUTION()'

    Any element is supposed to be named after your present use case. The function f is whatever the
    assignment is meant to do, e.g. f(X, Y, N) = N + X * Y for additive noise and multiplied parents.
    These functions need to be parsable by sympy to be correct.

    Parameters
    ----------
    assignment_strs: list
        The assignment strings.

    Returns
    -------
    dict,
        The functional map of variables with their parents, assignment strings, and noise models as needed to construct
        an SCM object.

    Extract the parent variables in an assignment string.

    --------
