===================
One Tap Sign In
===================

Description
-----------

One Tap Sign In is a Django library for integrating phone verification functionality into your web application. It simplifies the process of global phone number verification using OTP/passcode, similar to Gmail's One Tap Sign In feature. This library eliminates the need for complex telecom registration and SMS API Gateway integration for each country.

Installation
------------

You can install One Tap Sign In using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install one-tap-sign-in

Usage
-----

To configure One Tap Sign In in your Django project, you can set the client ID and access token using the following functions:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from one_tap_sign_in.config import set_client_id, set_access_token

    set_client_id("your_client_id")
    set_access_token("your_access_token")

Once configured, you can call the `get_verified_phone()` function in your views to retrieve the verified phone number:

.. code-block:: python

    # views.py
    from one_tap_sign_in.utils import get_verified_phone

    def my_view(request):
        # Call the get_verified_phone function
        phone_number = get_verified_phone()
        # Further logic based on the retrieved phone number
