# Installation

### User Installation Requirements (Seeq Data Lab)
If you want to install **seeq-plot-curve** as a Seeq Add-on Tool, you will need a version of Seeq Data Lab:

- Seeq Data Lab (> R50.5.0, >R51.1.0, or >R52.1.0)
- Seeq module whose version matches the Seeq server version, and the version of SPy >= 182.25
- Seeq server admin access

### User Installation (Seeq Data Lab)
1. Create a **new** Seeq Data Lab project, and open the terminal window.
2. Run pip install seeq-plot-curve
3. Run python -m seeq.addons.plot_curve [--users <users_list> --groups <groups_list>].  During the installation you will
   be prompted for your username/password (an access key can also be used).  It will also prompt for the url of the
   app notebook which will be available from the deployment folder in Seeq Data Lab.
4. Verify that the Plot Curve add-on is present in the AddOn menu in workbench.

# Development -- Generating a .addon file for drag and droo use with Add-on Manager 
To create a .addon, run `python package.py` from the top directory after pip installing all the requirements in requirements.txt (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). It will produce a .addon file in the same directory.

# Installation 
From the Add-on Manager UI, locate the name of the Add-on and click "Install". As of 10/27/2023, this is only available to users with access to the seeq-add-ons-dev-local Jfrog gallery. If you do not have access, use the deprecated source installation steps below.

### DEPRECATED - Source Installation

For development work, it is highly recommended creating a python virtual environment and install the package in that
working environment. If you are not familiar with python virtual environments, you can take a
look [here](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/venv.html)

Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install **seeq-plot-curve** from source with:

```shell
python setup.py install
```

# DEPRECATED - Development

We welcome new contributors of all experience levels.

- Official Source code repository : https://github.com/seeq12/seeq-plot-curve
- Issue tracker : https://github.com/seeq12/seeq-plot-curve/issues

You can get started by cloning the repository with the command : 
```sh
$ git clone git@gitub.com:seeq12/seeq-plot-curve.git
```

There is a template for the developer notebook in /development.  To get started, copy it to the root directory, create a new
virtual environment and install the requirements.

```sh
$ cp ./development/developer_notebook.ipynb developer_notebook.ipynb
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Next, modify the parameters within the workbook for your local environment (username, password, workbook, worksheet, etc.).
Finally, start a jupyter server and navigate to the development notebook in the root directory.

```sh
$ jupyter notebook
```

Documentation can be updated by editing the source files in docs/src/source, and then using the provided bat file to
generate the documentation in the docs folder, i.e.:

```sh
$ make.bat github
```
