    """Redistribute items randomly across all workers.

    Bytewax's execution model has workers executing all steps, but the
    state in each step is partitioned across workers by some key.
    Bytewax will only exchange an item between workers before stateful
    steps in order to ensure correctness, that they interact with the
    correct state for that key. Stateless operators (like
    {py:obj}`filter`) are run on all workers and do not result in
    exchanging items before or after they are run.

    This can result in certain ordering of operators to result in poor
    parallelization across an entire execution cluster. If the
    previous step (like a
    {py:obj}`bytewax.operators.window.reduce_window` or
    {py:obj}`input` with a
    {py:obj}`~bytewax.inputs.FixedPartitionedSource`) concentrated
    items on a subset of workers in the cluster, but the next step is
    a CPU-intensive stateless step (like a {py:obj}`map`), it's
    possible that not all workers will contribute to processing the
    CPU-intesive step.

    This operation has a overhead, since it will need to serialize,
    send, and deserialize the items, so while it can significantly
    speed up the execution in some cases, it can also make it slower.

    A good use of this operator is to parallelize an IO bound step,
    like a network request, or a heavy, single-cpu workload, on a
    machine with multiple workers and multiple cpu cores that would
    remain unused otherwise.

    A bad use of this operator is if the operation you want to
    parallelize is already really fast as it is, as the overhead can
    overshadow the advantages of distributing the work. Another case
    where you could see regressions in performance is if the heavy CPU
    workload already spawns enough threads to use all the available
    cores. In this case multiple processes trying to compete for the
    cpu can end up being slower than doing the work serially. If the
    workers run on different machines though, it might again be a
    valuable use of the operator.

    Use this operator with caution, and measure whether you get an
    improvement out of it.

    Once the work has been spread to another worker, it will stay on
    those workers unless other operators explicitely move the item
    again (usually on output).
