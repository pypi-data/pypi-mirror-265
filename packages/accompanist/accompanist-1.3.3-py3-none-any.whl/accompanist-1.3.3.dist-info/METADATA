# üéª Introduction

---

## What is Accomapnist?
Accompanist is an AWS WAF log analysis tool and an "accompanist" of WAF operation.  
It enables you to analyze AWS WAF logs and automatically generate instant analysis reports in just three simple steps.  
If you're operating AWS WAF, this tool can be helpful for instant log analysis and help you understand the trends of blocked or counted accesses.  

- Reporting Items
    - Histgram of requests
        - Total number
        - Number by each WAF rule provider
    - Top 5 for the following categories:
        - Rule group
        - Rule
        - Paths name
        - User agent
        - IP addressws
        - Country codes
    - Hit count on specific paths
    - Comment
        - An optional field where you can write additional notes

## Prerequisite

- Requirement
    - WAF: AWS WAFv2 and/or Third Party WAF (using WebACL)
    - Logging Destination: CloudWatch Logs or S3
    - Support Action: BLOCK, COUNT or EXCLUDED_AS_COUNT

- IAM Role/User policy
    - Example policies are noted in Appnedix, the last section of this page.

# üöÄ Get Started
---

## Install

```bash
$ pip install accompanist
```

## Usage

1. First, configure the settings using the following command; this will generate a `config.json` file. 

```bash
$ accompanist init
```

- You must set the log group name using this command, or you can choose to edit the `config.json` file directly.

2. Second, retrieve the query results with the following commnad. 

- For example, to retrieve the `BLOCK` log for the past three days

```bash
$ accompanist listen -a BLOCK -d 3
```

- If the log destination is S3, you can use "hear" instead of the "listen".

3. Finally, generate a report in PDF format.

```bash
$ accompanist play
```

## Uninstall

```bash
$ pip uninstall accompanist
```

# üå± How to use

## Convenient usage

- The "listen" or "hear" with `--json_log`  or `-j`  option can be help to investigate the detail of WAF logs.
    - [Important] Please handle it carefully as it may include sensitive or confidential information.
    - If you want to confirm a specific access of log, you should re-run "play" with the option and open a json file generated in the current directory.
- The report color is customizable for when you run "play" with the option, `--color` or `-d` .

## Precaution

- This tool works with AWS WAFv2 and does not support WAFv1.
- For AWS Managed Rules, you need to append "AWS" to the prefix, or the histogram works wrong.
- In COUNT action, as it is a well-known general mode of AWS WAF, COUNT or EXCLUDED_AS_COUNT is used.
- Using the "COUNT" action, the results are double counted by each rule.
- The logs may not be correctly calculated if you use the "Label" features in WAF.
- If the log destination is S3, it will take some time to acquire the log (several minutes)
- The analysis target period (days) can be set up to 40 days at most.

## IAM Policy for CWL

Here is an example of IAM policy with restricted permissions.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "logs:StartQuery",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:<region>:<aws-acount>:log-group:<log-group-name>:*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "logs:GetQueryResults",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: The `<region>`, `<aws-acount>` and `<log-group-name>` in this sample policy should be replaced.

## IAM Policy for S3

Here is an example of IAM policy with restricted permissions.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
