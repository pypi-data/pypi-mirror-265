# IBind

IBind is a REST and WebSocket client library for [Interactive Brokers Client Portal Web API.][gateway]

I recommend using this library along with [IBeam][ibeam] for easier authentication with IBKR.

## NOTICE
### This library is a work in progres. I haven't published it yet. Many things are due to change without any notice. 

Features:

* **REST Python client** - for IBKR REST API.
* **WebSocket Python client** - for IBKR WebSocket API.
* **Feature rich REST** - automated question/answer handling, parallel requests, rate limiting, conid unpacking, and more.
* **Feature rich WebSocket** - WebSocket thread lifecycle handling, thread-safe Queue data stream, internal subscription tracking, heartbeat monitoring, and more.


## Examples

See [all examples][examples]

### 01 IbkrClient basic

```python
import warnings

from ibind import IbkrClient

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message="Unverified HTTPS request is being made to host 'localhost'")

c = IbkrClient(url='https://localhost:5000/v1/api/')

print('\n#### check_health ####')
print(c.check_health())

print('\n\n#### tickle ####')
print(c.tickle().data)

print('\n\n#### get_accounts ####')
print(c.get_accounts().data)
```

### 02 IbkrClient intermediate
```python
import var

from ibind import IbkrClient
import ibind

ibind.logs.initialize()

c = IbkrClient(
    url='https://localhost:5000/v1/api/',
    cacert=var.IBKR_CACERT,
)

print('\n#### get_accounts ####')
accounts = c.get_accounts().data
c.account_id = accounts[0]['accountId']
print(accounts)

print('\n\n#### get_ledger ####')
ledger = c.get_ledger().data
for currency, subledger in ledger.items():
    print(f'\t Ledger currency: {currency}')
    print(f'\t cash balance: {subledger["cashbalance"]}')
    print(f'\t net liquidation value: {subledger["netliquidationvalue"]}')
    print(f'\t stock market value: {subledger["stockmarketvalue"]}')
    print()

print('\n#### get_positions ####')
positions = c.get_positions().data
for position in positions:
    print(f'\t Position {position["ticker"]}: {position["position"]} (${position["mktValue"]})')
```

### IbkrWsClient basic

```python
import os
import time

import ibind
from ibind.client.ibkr_definitions import snapshot_keys_to_ids
from ibind import IbkrWsKey, IbkrClient, IbkrWsClient

ibind.logs.initialize(log_to_file=False)

account_id = os.getenv('IBKR_ACCOUNT_ID', '[YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID]')

client = IbkrClient(
    account_id=account_id,
    url='https://localhost:5000/v1/api/',
)

ws_client = IbkrWsClient(
    ibkr_client=client,
    account_id=account_id,
    url='wss://localhost:5000/v1/api/ws'
)

ws_client.start()
channel = 'md+265598'
fields = [str(x) for x in snapshot_keys_to_ids(['symbol', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume',])]

qa = ws_client.new_queue_accessor(IbkrWsKey.MARKET_DATA)

ws_client.subscribe(channel, {'fields': fields}, needs_confirmation=False)

while ws_client.running:
    try:
        while not qa.empty():
            print(str(qa), qa.get())

        time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print('KeyboardInterrupt')
        break

ws_client.unsubscribe(channel, {'fields': fields}, needs_confirmation=False)

ws_client.shutdown()
```
