# QDarts
Efficient **Q**uantum **D**ot **ar**ray **t**ransition **s**imulator. 

## Description
We provide an efficient simulation package, QDarts, generating realistic charge conductance signals from medium, more than 10 quantum dot arrays. By levering the polytope finding algorithm from ()[], the QDarts allows for:
- Transition finding in high-dimensional voltage space, 
- Selection of arbitrary cuts in the voltage space,
- Simulating effects of finite tunnel couplings,
- Including non-constant charging energies,
- Simulation of multiple sensor dot,
- Tunable noise parameters,
- User-friendly interface.

## Installation
The package supports Python 3.6 and later. To install the package, run the following command:

    pip install qdarts

## Manuscript
The package is based on the manuscript by [Krzywda et al., QDarts: A Quantum Dot Array Transition Simulator for finding charge transitions in the presence of finite tunnel couplings, non-constant charging energies and sensor dots](). The manuscript has been submitted to the SciPost Physics Codebases.

## Examples
The package provides a simple example to demonstrate the usage of the package. The example is available in the examples qatpack/examples folder. The example demonstrates the simulation of a quantum dot array with sensor dots, tunnel couplings, and non-constant charging energy. 

As a proof of principle, in the example we reconstruct the figure from the paper [Neyens et al.](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.12.064049z), which shows the measured charge conductance signal from two sensor dots, which detect simultanous four-dot transition in the quantum dot array. The figure, visible below, has been computed in about a minute on a standard laptop.
