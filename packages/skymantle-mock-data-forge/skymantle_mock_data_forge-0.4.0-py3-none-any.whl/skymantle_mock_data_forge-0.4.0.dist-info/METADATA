           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Skymantle Mock Data Forge

A package for managing test data on aws resources through configuration, when running integration and end-to-end tests in the cloud. Currently the package supports managing data on DynamoDb and S3.

## Installation
To install use:

```
pip3 install skymantle_mock_data_forge
```

## Usage

Use the forge factory to manage data to multiple destinations (any combination of DynamoDB tables and S3 buckets). An id is used to specify each unique destination. The forge factor provides the following functions:

- `load_data` - will load data across all destinations or the destination of the provided forge ID
- `get_data` - will return data across all destinations or the data for the provided forge ID, will only return data created by the forge
- `get_data_first_item` - will return first item of data across all destinations or the data for the provided forge ID, will only return data created by the forge
- `add_key` - when new data is created through tests you can provide it's key so that it's included in the `cleanup_data` call
- `cleanup_data` - will remove data across all destinations or the destination of the provided forge ID

### Examples

- manage data in DynamoDB, assumes aws credentials environment variable are set, such as `AWS_PROFILE`

```python
from skymantle_mock_data_forge.forge_factory import ForgeFactory

config = [
    {
        "forge_id": "some_config_id",
        "dynamodb": {
            "table": {"name": "some_table"},
            "primary_key_names": ["PK"],
            "items": [{"data": {"PK": "some_key_1", "Description": "Some description 1"}}],
        },
    }
]

factory = ForgeFactory(config)
factory.load_data()

# perform tests

factory.add_key("some_config_id", {"PK": "some_key_2"})
factory.cleanup_data()
```

-  Load config from a json file

```python
from skymantle_mock_data_forge.forge_factory import ForgeFactory

factory = ForgeFactory("path/to/file.json")
factory.load_data()

# perform tests

factory.add_key("some_config_id", {"PK": "some_key_2"})
factory.cleanup_data()
```

- Managing multiple destinations

```python
from skymantle_mock_data_forge.forge_factory import ForgeFactory

config = [
    {
        "forge_id": "some_config_id_1",
        "dynamodb": {
            "table": {"name": "some_table"},
            "primary_key_names": ["PK"],
            "items": [{"data": {"PK": "some_key_1", "Description": "Some description 1"}}],
        },
    },
    {
        "forge_id": "some_config_id_2",
        "s3": {
            "bucket": {"name": "some_bucket"},
            "s3_objects": [{"key": "some_key", "data": {"base64": "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"}}],
        },
    }
]

factory = ForgeFactory(config)

# To load a single destination
factory.load_data("some_config_id_2")

# To load all destinations
factory.load_data()

# ...
```

- Provide forge factory with an AWS session

```python
from boto3 import Session
# ...

session = Session(profile_name="developer")
factory = ForgeFactory(config, session)

# ...
```

- Use queries to get specific data for use in tests by querying custom tags.

```python
from datetime import UTC, datetime
from skymantle_mock_data_forge.forge_factory import ForgeFactory

config = [
    {
        "forge_id": "some_config_id",
        "dynamodb": {
            "table": {"name": "some_table"},
            "primary_key_names": ["PK"],
            "items": [
                {
                    "tags": {
                        "tests": [
                            "test_get_items", 
                            "test_get_item", 
                            "test_update_item",
                        ],
                    },
                    "data": {"PK": "some_key_1", "Description": "Some description 1"},
                },
                {
                    "tags": {"tests": "test_item_delete"},
                    "data": {"PK": "some_key_2", "Description": "Some description 2"},
                },
            ],
        },
    }
]

factory = ForgeFactory(config, overrides=overrides)
factory.load_data()

#...
# Unit test for deleting an item

data = factory.get_data(query={"StringEquals": {"tests": "test_item_delete"}})
pK_to_delete = data[0]["data"]["PK]

#...
```

- Override specific values at run time. Useful when config files are stored in static json files or handling dates

```python
from datetime import UTC, datetime
from skymantle_mock_data_forge.forge_factory import ForgeFactory
from skymantle_mock_data_forge.models import OverrideType

config = [
    {
        "forge_id": "some_config_id",
        "dynamodb": {
            "table": {"name": "some_table"},
            "primary_key_names": ["PK"],
            "items": [{"data": {"PK": "some_key_1", "Description": "Some description 1", "CreateDate": ""}}],
        },
    }
]

overrides = [
    {
        "key_paths": "CreateDate",
        "override_type": OverrideType.REPLACE_VALUE,
        "override": datetime.now(UTC).isoformat(),
    }
]

factory = ForgeFactory(config, overrides=overrides)
factory.load_data("some_config_id")

# ...
```


## Configuration

The forge factory takes a list of configuration, each item in the lists must represent a single destination, either DynamoDB or S3.

For the DynamoDb configuration, the table name can be specific or  provided through an SSM parameter or the output of a CloudFormation stack

- By table name

```json
{
    "forge_id": "some_config_id_1",
    "dynamodb": {
        "table": {"name": "some_table"},
        "primary_key_names": ["PK"],
        "items": [{"data": {"PK": "some_key_1", "Description": "Some description 1"}}],
    }
}
```

- By SSM parameter

```json
{
    "forge_id": "some_config_id_1",
    "dynamodb": {
        "table": {"ssm": "ssm_parameter_key"},
        "primary_key_names": ["PK"],
        "items": [{"data": {"PK": "some_key_1", "Description": "Some description 1"}}],
    }
}
```

- By CloudFormation stack output

```json
{
    "forge_id": "some_config_id_1",
    "dynamodb": {
        "table": {
            "stack": {
                "name": "cfn_stack_name",
                "output": "table_output_name"
            }
        },
        "primary_key_names": ["PK"],
        "items": [{"data": {"PK": "some_key_1", "Description": "Some description 1"}}],
    }
}
```


For the S3 configuration, the bucket name can be specific or  provided through an SSM parameter or the output of a CloudFormation stack (similar to DynamoDB). 

The following object data is supported:
- text
- json
- base64
- csv
- file

```json
{
    "forge_id": "some_config_id_1",
    "s3": {
        "bucket": {"name": "some_bucket"},
        "s3_objects": [
            {
                "key": "some_key_1", 
                "data": {"text": "Some Data"}
            },
            {
                "key": "some_key_2", 
                "data": {"json": {"some_key": "some_value"}}
            },
            {
                "key": "some_key_3", 
                "data": {"base64": "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"}
            },
            {
                "key": "some_key_4", 
                "data": {
                    "csv": [
                        ["a", "b"],
                        ["c", "d"],
                        ["e", "f"],
                        [1, 2],
                    ]
                }
            },
            {
                "key": "some_key_5", 
                "data": {"file": "path/to/file"}
            },
        ]
    }
}
```

## Querying Data For Testing

Custom tags can be added to data that is managed by the forges, this will make it possible to categorize and group data for use during tests. Tags are completely optional, but required for querying.

- DynamoDB tag example
```json
[
    {
        "tags": {
            "tests": ["test_get_item", "test_update_item"]
        },
        "data": {"PK": "some_key_1", "Description": "Some description 1"},
    },
    {
        "tags": {"tests": "test_item_delete"},
        "data": {"PK": "some_key_2", "Description": "Some description 2"},
    },
]
```

- S3 tag example
```json
[
    {
        "key": "some_key_1",
        "tags": {"type": "text", "tests": ["test_1", "test_2"], "segment": "reporting"},
        "data": {"text": "Some Data"},
    },
    {
        "key": "some_key_2",
        "tags": {"type": "json", "tests": "test_3"},
        "data": {"json": {"key": "value"}},
    }
]
```

A query is made up of an operator and 1 or more condition key/value pairs. Supported operators are:

 - StringEquals - the value for the tag must match exactly to one of the items in the specified tag
 - StringLike - the value must be contained in on of the items in the specified tag

 It's also possible to use both operators in the query. When dealing with multiple conditions and/or operators, queries are limited to logical `AND` queries.

 ### Examples

For the data provided
 ``` json
[
    {
        "tags": {
            "record_type": "person",
            "tests": [
                "test_get_items", 
                "test_get_item", 
                "test_update_item"
            ]
        },
        "data": {"PK": "some_key_1", "Description": "Some description 1"}
    },
    {
        "tags": {
            "record_type": "building",
            "tests": [
                "test_get_items", 
                "test_get_item", 
                "test_update_item"
            ]
        },
        "data": {"PK": "some_key_2", "Description": "Some description 2"}
    },
    {
        "tags": {
            "record_type": "building",
            "tests": "item_delete"
        },
        "data": {"PK": "some_key_2", "Description": "Some description 2"}
    }
]
```

- `{"StringLike": {"tests": "get"}}` will return

```json
[
    {
        "tags": {
            "record_type": "person",
            "tests": [
                "test_get_items", 
                "test_get_item", 
                "test_update_item"
            ]
        },
        "data": {"PK": "some_key_1", "Description": "Some description 1"}
    },
    {
        "tags": {
            "record_type": "building",
            "tests": [
                "test_get_items", 
                "test_get_item", 
                "test_update_item"
            ]
        },
        "data": {"PK": "some_key_2", "Description": "Some description 2"}
    }
]
```

- `{"StringEquals": {"tests": "test_get_item", "record_type": "building"}}` will return

```json
[
    {
        "tags": {
            "record_type": "building",
            "tests": [
                "test_get_items", 
                "test_get_item", 
                "test_update_item"
            ]
        },
        "data": {"PK": "some_key_2", "Description": "Some description 2"}
    }
]
```

- `{"StringEquals": {"record_type": "building"}, "StringLike": {"tests": "test"}}` will return

```json
[
    {
        "tags": {
            "record_type": "building",
            "tests": [
                "test_get_items", 
                "test_get_item", 
                "test_update_item"
            ]
        },
        "data": {"PK": "some_key_2", "Description": "Some description 2"}
    }
]
```

## Overrides


In some cases it's easier to store config files in json for sharing. When coming from static sources, overrides allow data to be changed at runtime. this can be used for setting values like the AWS account id for the current context or the current date. The following type of modifications can be used:

- Replace Value
    - Will replace the value with a new one
    - For example if create date is current "" it can be replaced with "2023-01-01"
- Format Value
    - Will used pythons `str.format(*args)`
    - The original value must be a string, the replacement is index based.
    - For example if description is "{} Assemble{}" it back be formatted to "Avengers Assemble!"
- Call Function
    - will call a custom function when processing each item.
    - The signature of the function is func(key: str, value: any, context: dict) -> any:
        - key - The current key (ie: CreateDate)
        - value - The current value for the given key
        - context - The current item being built
        - return - the new value.

In the case of nested dictionaries, key paths are supported which are "." separated, key paths will also traverse sub lists. Currently it's not possible to specify an index, all items in the list will be updated. 

If the same override is needed for multiple keys then a list of key paths can be used. Currently overrides only work with json structured data. 

The default behaviour for overrides is to ignore key path errors, however this behaviour can be altered by setting the `DATA_FORGE_SUPPRESS_KEY_PATH_ERRORS` environment variable. Supported values are `0`, `false`, `no` and `off`.

### Example

```python
# Current config stored in full or in part in json files

[
    {
        "forge_id": "some_config_id",
        "dynamodb": {
            "table": {"name": "some_table"},
            "primary_key_names": ["pk"],
            "items": [
                {
                    "data": {
                        "pk": "", 
                        "description": "Executed on {0} Environment.",
                        "audit": { "create_date": "", "last_update_date": "" },
                        "items": [{"id":""}, {"id":""}]
                    }
                },
                {
                    "data": {
                        "pk": "",

                    }
                }
            ],
        },
    }
]

# Overrides

def generate_id(key: str, value: any, context: dict) -> any:
    return str(uuid.uuid4())

current_date = datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()
environment = os.environ.get("ENVIRONMENT")

overrides = [
    {
        "key_paths": [
            "data.pk",

        ]
    }
},


```

By default, the same list of overrides is distributed to all destinations, if an override needs to vary by destination a forge Id can be provided.

```python

overrides = [
    { # Will go to all destinations
        "key_paths": "data.text",
        "override_type": OverrideType.REPLACE_VALUE,
        "override": "Some Other Data",
    },
    { # Will go to some_config_1
        "forge_id": "some_config_1",
        "key_paths": "PK",
        "override_type": OverrideType.REPLACE_VALUE,
        "override": "some_other_key_1",
    },
    { # Will go to some_config_2
        "forge_id": "some_config_2",
        "key_paths": "PK",
        "override_type": OverrideType.REPLACE_VALUE,
        "override": "some_other_key_2",
    }
]

```
