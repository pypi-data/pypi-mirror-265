Phone Email One Tap Sign In
============================

Description
-----------

One Tap Sign In is a Django library developed by Phone.Email for integrating phone verification functionality into your website. It simplifies the process of global phone number verification using OTP/passcode, similar to Gmail's One Tap Sign In feature. This library eliminates the need for complex telecom registration and SMS API Gateway integration for each country.

Installation
------------

You can install One Tap Sign In using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install phone-email-auth

Usage
-----

To get verified phone number call `get_user_info()` function in your views:

.. code-block:: python

    # views.py
    from phone_email_auth.utils import get_user_info

    def my_view(request):
        # Call the get_verified_phone function
        if 'access_token' in request.GET:
            country_code,phone_number = get_user_info('TYPE_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE',request.GET['access_token'])
            context = {
                'phone_number': phone_number,
                'country_code' : country_code
            }

        response = render(request, 'index.html', context)
        # Further logic based on the retrieved phone number
