# My Streamlit Chart Component

Welcome to My Streamlit Chart Component, a versatile charting library designed for the Streamlit framework. This component allows users to quickly and easily create a variety of interactive charts to visualize their data within a Streamlit application.

## Installation

To install My Streamlit Chart Component, run the following command:

```
pip install my-streamlit-chart-component
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the component in your Streamlit app to render charts. Here's how to get started:

```python

from my_streamlit_component.st_chart_component import my_chart_component

# Define your data
data = {
    "labels": ["January", "February", "March", "April"],
    "datasets": [
        {
            "label": "My Data",
            "data": [10, 20, 30, 40],
            # Further dataset properties...
        }
    ],
}

# Render a chart
my_chart_component(data=data, chart_type="bar")
```
