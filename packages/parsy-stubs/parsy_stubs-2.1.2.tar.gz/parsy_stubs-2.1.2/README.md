# Stub files for Parsy

[Parsy](https://github.com/python-parsy/parsy) is an extremely elegant
monadic parser combinator library for LL(infinity) grammars.

This library aims to enhance your developer experience (as well as catching a
swathe of bugs before you run any test using static type checking with tools like Mypy)
by providing type-hinting.

## Installation

```shell
pip install parsy-stubs
```
