    'long_description': '# representty\n\n`representty` is a tiny presentation framework. TL;DR: You write your slides in\nMarkdown, `rich` renders individual slides, and the whole thing happens in an\nIPython shell.\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/584388.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/584388)\n\n## File Format\n\nA slide deck is mostly a Markdown file. Individual slides are seperated by a\nbunch of equals signs.\n\nAdditionally, you can start a line with:\n\n- `//`: comment; the line is ignored (unless the environment variable\n  `PRACTICE` is set).\n- `!`: special instruction. The line is not included in the output, but can do\n  a variety of things:\n    - `!!some command`: execute the command with `os.system()` the first time\n      this slide is visited.\n    - `!import somemodule`: silently import the given module.\n    - `!set flag`/`!unset flag`: set/unset a named flag. These can influence\n      `representty` behaviour. See [flags](#flags).\n    - `!setlocal flag`/`!unsetlocal flag`: (un)set a flag, but reset to\n      original value at the end of the slide.\n    - `!image someimage`: Display an image. This only works if you have\n      `viu` installed.\n    - `!up some_int`: Move the cursor up by some amount. Useful for drawing\n      over images.\n    - `!printf something`: Call `printf` with the given args. Better than\n      plain `!!printf`, because it will be executed every time the slide is\n      displayed by default.\n\nPython code blocks (language starts with `py`) are not just rendered, but also\nexecuted.\n\n## Commands\n\nThe presenter is dropped into a more-or-less normal IPython shell. A few\nsingle-letter commands exist which control the slide show:\n\n- `d`: (Re)draw the current slide.\n- `n`: Go to the next slide.\n- `p`: Go to the previous slide.\n- `q`: Quit.\n- `g`: Go to a numbered slide (you will be prompted for a slide number).\n- `s`: Go to a slide by searching for a keyword (you will be prompted).\n\n## Flags\n\n- `exec`: whether to execute Python code in code blocks. Default: set.\n- `alwaysexec`: Always execute shell commands (`!!`), rather than just at the\n  first printing of the slide. Default: unset.\n',
