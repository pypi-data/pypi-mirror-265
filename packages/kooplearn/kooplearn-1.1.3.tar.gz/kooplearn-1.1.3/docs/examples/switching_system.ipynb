    "In this example we show how Koopman theory can be used to analyze the behaviour of a switching system, validating our results with Fourier theory. We study a simple signal composed by a sum of a small number of sinusoidal functions. These signals are easily analyzed using Fourier theory, but similar results can be obtained via Koopman theory and its implementation in `kooplearn`. In particular, we show that how to recover changes in the signal by detecting changes in the underlying process. Here, this will be modeled by a sudden change of the dominant frequencies of the signal during a _switching_ period.\n",

    "Observe that we do recover the correct frequencies. When the signal is composed of only two frequencies, they appear with high ammplitude in the koopman operator. Other noisy frequencies are selected since the rank of the ``kooplearn`` model was larger than 4, but as expected they have a smaller amplitude since they are not truely part of the signal. We also observe that frequencies at the margin of the two regimes are slightly meaned, which is an effect of the sliding window that is also observed in the Fourier spectrogram. Reducing the size of the moving window will reduce this blending of frequencies at the cost of a lower precision."

    "First, notice that the frequencies given by mode decomposition are always in the same order. To homogenize our vectors we must sort them in increasing order. Do notice that if the rank of the model is overestimated, the frequency vector will contain many unreliable frequencies that can alter the position of the relevant ones. For instance, in the second regime of our data, the Koopman operator with rank 8 has 4 frequencies of low amplitude that change randomly between windows. One should consider either filtering out these noisy frequencies before clustering or reducing the rank of the Koopman operator."
