# TODO

## general
- Terminology across recruiters / or per recruiter: Assignment ID, HIT ID, Worker ID, etc.

## recruiter-exit
- "Below is information you may need to receive compensation for your participation." although we said 'automatically' on reward page
- `base_payment` on very last page is 0.34 although reward is 0.1 on previous reward page
- Fix 'Base pay', 'HIT ID', 'Assignment ID'
- Bonus 8.876666666666667 not rounded (`demo_static`)

## Refactor
- "{:.2f}".format(

## Fix
- "$" + "{:.2f}" (use `currency`)
