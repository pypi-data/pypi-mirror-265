Tapping imitation chain
=======================

This is a more complex example of an imitation chain experiment.
Here participants have to tap along to a particular rhythm. Their tapping is recorded
via the laptop microphone, and fed back to the PsyNet server which extracts the tap timings
using a signal-processing pipeline.
