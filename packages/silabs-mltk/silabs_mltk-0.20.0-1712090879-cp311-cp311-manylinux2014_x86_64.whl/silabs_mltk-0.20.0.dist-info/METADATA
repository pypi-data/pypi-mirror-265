Silicon Labs Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK)
==============================================

__NOTICE:__

This package is considered EXPERIMENTAL - SILICON LABS DOES NOT OFFER ANY WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES CONCERNING THIS SOFTWARE.
This package is made available as a self-serve reference supported only by the on-line documentation, and community support.
There are no Silicon Labs support services for this software at this time.


This is a Python package with command-line utilities and scripts to aid the development
of machine learning models for Silicon Lab's embedded platforms.

See the [MLTK Overview](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/overview.html) for an overview of how the various features of the MLTK are used to
create machine learning models for embedded devices.

The features of this Python package include:
- [Command-line](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/command_line/index.html) - Execute all ML operations from simple command-line interface
- [Python API](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/python_api/python_api.html) - Execute all ML operations from a Python script
- [Model Profiler](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_profiler.html) - Determine how efficiently an ML model will execute on an embedded platform
- [Model Training](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_training.html) - Train an ML model using [Google Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Model Training Monitor](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_training_monitor.html) - Monitor/profile the training of a model using [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)
- [Remote Training via SSH](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_training_via_ssh.html) - Securely and seamlessly train the model on a remote "cloud" machine
- [Model Evaluation](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_evaluation.html) - Evaluate a trained ML model's accuracy and other metrics
- [Model Summary](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_summary.html) - Generate a summary of the model's contents
- [Model Visualization](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_visualizer.html) - Interactively view the ML model's structure
- [Model Quantization](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_quantization.html) - Reduce the memory footprint of an ML model by using the [Tensorflow-Lite Converter](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert)
- [Model Parameters](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/guides/model_parameters.html) - Embed custom parameters into the generated model file
- [Audio Utilities](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/audio/audio_utilities.html) - Utilities to visualize and classify real-time audio for keyword spotting
- [Python C++ Wrappers](https://siliconlabs.github.io/mltk/docs/cpp_development/wrappers/index.html) - Execute C++ libraries (including [Tensorflow-Lite Micro](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro)) from a Python interface
