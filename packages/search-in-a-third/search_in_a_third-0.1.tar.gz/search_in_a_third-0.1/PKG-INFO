# Search in a Third

Search in a Third is a Python package designed for optimization of hyperparameters in neural networks with an emphasis on moderate computational usage. It utilizes a greedy algorithm guided by heuristic directions that avoid traversing the entire multidimensional space of hyperparameters to achieve an optimal configuration of models efficiently.

## Features

- **Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization**: Focuses on reducing the number of models trained while still achieving optimal results.
- **Greedy Algorithm with Heuristic Guidance**: Narrows down the search space intelligently to find the best model configurations without exhaustive search.
- **Optimized Computational Use**: Designed to make the most out of available computational resources, avoiding unnecessary model training.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install search_in_a_third
```
