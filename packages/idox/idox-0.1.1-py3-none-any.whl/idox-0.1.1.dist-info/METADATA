### Example usage

Imagine you have a website that looks like the following:

```text
https://domain.com/images/5/download
https://domain.com/images/6/download
```

Then you could use the following burp request:

`request.txt`
```text
GET /images/$INJECT$/download HTTP/1.1
Host: domain.com


```

To IDOR all images with the id's from `0` to `100` like so

```shell
python -m idox --request-file-path request.txt 100
```

This would create an `output` directory which stores all the responses from your target site by response content type.

For further usage, see `python -m idox --help` or the `data` directory.
