ST (StringTemplate) is a template engine for generating source code,
web pages, emails, or any other formatted text output.
ST is particularly good at multi-targeted code generators,
multiple site skins, and internationalization/localization.
It evolved over years of effort developing jGuru.com.
ST also generates this website and powers the ANTLR v3 code generator.
Its distinguishing characteristic is that
it strictly enforces model-view separation unlike other engines.
