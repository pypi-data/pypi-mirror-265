    This interface describes an object that knows how to format or otherwise

    for objects such as Date and floating point numbers...  You can either
    have an object that is sensitive to the locale or have a different object
    per locale.

    Each template may have a renderer for each object type or can default
    to the group's renderer or the super group's renderer if the group doesn't
    have one.

    The toString(Object,String) method is used when the user uses the
    format option: $o; format="f"$.  It checks the formatName and applies the
    appropriate formatting.  If the format string passed to the renderer is
    not recognized then simply call toString().

    Essentially a char filter that knows how to auto-indent output
    by maintaining a stack of indent levels.  I set a flag upon newline

    The indent stack is a stack of strings, so we can repeat original indent
    not just the same number of columns (don't have to worry about tabs vs
    spaces then).

    Anchors are char positions (tabs won't work) that indicate where all
    future wraps should justify to.  The wrap position is actually the
    largest of either the last anchor or the indentation level.
    
    This is a filter on a Writer.

    '\n' is the proper way to say newline for options and templates.
    Templates can mix them but use '\n' for sure on options like wrap="\n".
    ST will generate the right thing.
    Override the default (locale) newline by passing in a string to the constructor.
