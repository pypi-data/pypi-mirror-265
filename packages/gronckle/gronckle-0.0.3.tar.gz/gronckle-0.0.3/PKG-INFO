Gronckle is a layer of LLM application infrastructure designed to help developers get higher quality content from their underlying LLMs without having to change which LLMs they're using or how their application works

# Requirements
We're building this package with the assumption that developers will be using a specific stack:
**Vector Database** --> Cassandra
**Vector Database Provider** --> Astra by Datastax
