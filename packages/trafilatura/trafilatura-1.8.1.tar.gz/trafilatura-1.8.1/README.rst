Introduction
------------


Trafilatura is a cutting-edge **Python package and command-line tool** designed to **gather text on the Web and simplify the process of turning raw HTML into structured, meaningful data**. It includes all necessary discovery and text processing components to perform **web crawling, downloads, scraping, and extraction** of main texts, metadata and comments. It aims at staying **handy and modular**: no database is required, the output can be converted to commonly used formats.

Going from HTML bulk to essential parts can alleviate many problems related to text quality, by **focusing on the actual content**, **avoiding the noise** caused by recurring elements (headers, footers etc.), and **making sense of the data** with selected information. The extractor is designed to be **robust and reasonably fast**, it runs in production on millions of documents.

The tool's versatility makes it **useful for quantitative and data-driven approaches**. It is used in the academic domain and beyond (e.g. in natural language processing, computational social science, search engine optimization, and information security).


Features
~~~~~~~~

- Advanced web crawling and text discovery:
   - Support for sitemaps (TXT, XML) and feeds (ATOM, JSON, RSS)
   - Smart crawling and URL management (filtering and deduplication)
- Parallel processing of online and offline input:
   - Live URLs, efficient and polite processing of download queues
   - Previously downloaded HTML files and parsed HTML trees
- Robust and configurable extraction of key elements:
   - Main text (common patterns and generic algorithms like jusText and readability)
   - Metadata (title, author, date, site name, categories and tags)
   - Formatting and structure: paragraphs, titles, lists, quotes, code, line breaks, in-line text formatting
   - Optional elements: comments, links, images, tables
- Multiple output formats:
   - Text (minimal formatting or Markdown)
   - CSV (with metadata)
   - JSON (with metadata)
   - XML or `XML-TEI <https://tei-c.org/>`_ (with metadata, text formatting and page structure)
- Optional add-ons:
   - Language detection on extracted content
   - Graphical user interface (GUI)
   - Speed optimizations
- Actively maintained with support from the open-source community:
   - Regular updates, feature additions, and optimizations
   - Comprehensive documentation


Evaluation and alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trafilatura consistently outperforms other open-source libraries in text extraction benchmarks, showcasing its efficiency and accuracy in extracting web content. The extractor tries to strike a balance between limiting noise and including all valid parts.

Context
-------

Developed with practical applications of academic research in mind, this software is part of a broader effort to derive information from web documents. Extracting and pre-processing web texts to the exacting standards of scientific research presents a substantial challenge. This software package simplifies text data collection and enhances corpus quality, it is currently used to build `text databases for linguistic research <https://www.dwds.de/d/k-web>`_.

*Trafilatura* is an Italian word for `wire drawing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_drawing>`_ symbolizing the refinement and conversion process. It is also the way shapes of pasta are formed.
