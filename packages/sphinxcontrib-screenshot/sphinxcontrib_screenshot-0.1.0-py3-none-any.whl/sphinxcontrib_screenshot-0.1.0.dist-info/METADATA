# sphinxcontrib-screenshot

A Sphinx extension to embed website screenshots.

## Install

```bash
pip install sphinxcontrib-screenshot
playwright install
```

## Usage

Add `sphinxcontrib.screenshot` to your `conf.py`.

```py
extensions = ["sphinxcontrib.screenshot"]
```

Then use the `screenshot` directive in your Sphinx source file.

```rst
.. screenshot:: http://www.example.com
```

You can also specify the screen size for the screenshot with `width` and `height` parameters.

```rst
.. screenshot:: http://www.example.com
  :width: 1280
  :height: 960
```

You can include a caption for the screenshot's `figure` directive.

```rst
.. screenshot:: http://www.example.com
  :caption: This is a screenshot for www.example.com
```

You can describe the interaction that you want to have with the webpage before taking a screenshot. `page` is the [Playwright's Page instance](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page).

```rst
.. screenshot:: http://www.example.com

    page.get_by_role('link').click()
```


## Notes

This extension uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) to capture a screenshot of the specified website only.
No data is sent to any other external server; the request is limited to the specified website.
Be cautious: avoid including sensitive information (such as authentication data) in the directive content.
