# Sample text for analysis
text = "In the heart of Silicon Valley, a collaboration has emerged between global tech giants such as Google, Apple, and Facebook, aiming to revolutionize the digital landscape."

# Call the function
result_df = org(text, openai_key, model='gpt-3.5-turbo', save=False)

# Display the extracted organizations
print(result_df)
```

# Arguments
