Casioplot for computer
======================

    Module ``casioplot`` from Casio calculator for Computer.

This can help to develop python programs in your computer and run it before put it in your calculator.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install casioplot

This module use python 3.10.0.

Need the module ``Pillow`` to work.

**Install Pillow:**

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install pillow

Usage example
-------------

Draw a single pixel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python3

    from casioplot import *

    red = (255, 0, 0)
    set_pixel(10, 10, red)
    show_screen()  # Don't forget to show the screen to see the result.

    :alt: A single pixel on the screen

For more examples and usage, please refer to the `Docs <https://casioplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Notes on performance
--------------------

The performance you get in the computer is not representative of the performance on the calculatores.
Keep in mind the following differences:

* Obviously ever operation that isn't from the casioplot package is going to be faster in the Computer
* clear_screen, set_pixel, get_pixel and draw_string are faster in the computer
* show_screen is slower in the computer

For example, the following codes draw a black square of 100 by 100 pixels.

.. code-block:: python3

    for x in range(100):
        for y in range(100):
            set_pixel(x, y)
    show_screen()

Is faster on the computer, but

.. code-block:: python3

    for x in range(100):
        for y in range(100):
            set_pixel(x, y)
            show_screen()

Is slower.

Development setup
-----------------

Nothing needed.
