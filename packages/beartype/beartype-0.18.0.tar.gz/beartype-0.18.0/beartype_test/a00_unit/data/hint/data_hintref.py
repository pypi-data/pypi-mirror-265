'''
Project-wide  **forward reference data submodule.**

This submodule exercises **forward reference type hints** (i.e., strings whose
values are the names of classes and tuples of classes, one or more of which
typically have yet to be defined) support implemented in the
:func:`beartype.beartype` decorator. This support can *only* be fully exercised
from within an independent data submodule rather than the body of a unit test.
Why? Because:

* That decorator is only safely importable from within the body of a unit test.
* Forward reference type hints can only refer to objects defined at module
  scope rather than from within the body of a unit test.
* Forward reference type hints referring to objects previously defined at
  module scope fail to exercise the deferred nature of forward references.
* Ergo, callables that are decorated by that decorator, annotated by one or
  more forward reference type hints, and both declared and called from within
  the body of a unit test fail to exercise this deferred nature.
* Ergo, only callables that are decorated by that decorator, annotated by one or
  more forward reference type hints, and both declared and called at module
  scope before their referents exercise this deferred nature.

#FIXME: Technically, @beartype *MAYBE* could actually resolve nested forward
#references by dynamically inspecting the call stack (depending on whether
#Python injects parent callables into the call stacks of closures, which it
#probably does, but there's no way of knowing until we try, and that's a lot of
#work to go to for potentially no gain whatsoever if Python doesn't behave like
#we think it does). That gets real cray-cray and non-portable real fast, so
#we're better off avoiding that unless we absolutely must -- and we mustn't,
#because PEP 484 + 563 + Python 3.10 means that unqualified forward references
#*MUST* now refer to globally scoped classes. So... why even bother, you know?

# Note that we do *NOT* bother declaring nested callables annotated with forward
# references to nested classes. Why? Unlike static analysis tooling, runtime
# decorators have *NO* internal access into nested lexical scopes and thus
# *CANNOT* by definition resolve forward references to nested classes.
#
# For example, the following callable is callable without exception but the
# closures returned by that callable are *NOT*, because @beartype fails to
# resolve the nested forward references annotating those closures:
#     from collections.abc import Callable
#     from typing import Tuple
