## Typing stubs for hdbcli

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the `hdbcli` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`hdbcli`.

This version of `types-hdbcli` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `hdbcli==2.20.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/hdbcli. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `027115e6249f17f9dee2c0372c4609335a1b9e7d` and was tested
with mypy 1.9.0, pyright 1.1.356, and
pytype 2024.3.19.
