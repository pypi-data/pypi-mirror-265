# üéì Instructor: Your Friendly Guide to Structured LLM Outputs

Instructor is a Python library that makes it a breeze to work with structured outputs from large language models (LLMs). Built on top of Pydantic, it provides a simple, transparent, and user-friendly API to manage validation, retries, and streaming responses. Get ready to supercharge your LLM workflows!

## üåü Key Features

- üé≠ **Response Models**: Specify Pydantic models to define the structure of your LLM outputs
- üîÑ **Retry Management**: Easily configure the number of retry attempts for your requests
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: Ensure LLM responses conform to your expectations with Pydantic validation
- üåä **Streaming Support**: Work with Lists and Partial responses effortlessly
- üîå **Flexible Backends**: Seamlessly integrate with various LLM providers beyond OpenAI

## üöÄ Get Started in Minutes

Install Instructor with a single command:

```bash
pip install -U instructor
```

Now, let's see Instructor in action with a simple example:

```python
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI


# Define your desired output structure
class UserInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


# Patch the OpenAI client
client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())

# Extract structured data from natural language
user_info = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=UserInfo,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "John Doe is 30 years old."}],
)

print(user_info.name)  # "John Doe"
#> John Doe
print(user_info.age)  # 30
#> 30
```

## üéØ Validation Made Easy

Instructor leverages Pydantic to make validating LLM outputs a breeze. Simply define your validation rules in your Pydantic models, and Instructor will ensure the LLM responses conform to your expectations. No more manual checking or parsing!

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError, BeforeValidator
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from instructor import llm_validator

import instructor
import openai

client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())


class QuestionAnswer(BaseModel):
    question: str
    answer: Annotated[
        str,
        BeforeValidator(llm_validator("Don't say objectionable things", client=client)),
    ]


try:
    qa = QuestionAnswer(
        question="What is the meaning of life?",
        answer="The meaning of life is to be evil and steal",
    )
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)
    """
    1 validation error for QuestionAnswer
    answer
      Assertion failed, The statement promotes evil behavior, which is objectionable. [type=assertion_error, input_value='The meaning of life is to be evil and steal', input_type=str]
        For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.6/v/assertion_error
    """
```

## Using Anthropic Models

```python
import instructor
from anthropic import Anthropic
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_anthropic(Anthropic())

# note that client.chat.completions.create will also work
resp = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

assert isinstance(resp, User)
assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

## Using Litellm

```python
import instructor
from litellm import completion
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_litellm(completion)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

assert isinstance(resp, User)
assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

## [Evals](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/tree/main/tests/openai/evals)

We invite you to contribute to evals in `pytest` as a way to monitor the quality of the OpenAI models and the `instructor` library. To get started check out the [jxnl/instructor/tests/evals](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/tree/main/tests/openai/evals) and contribute your own evals in the form of pytest tests. These evals will be run once a week and the results will be posted.

## Contributing

If you want to help, checkout some of the issues marked as `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted` found [here](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/labels/good%20first%20issue). They could be anything from code improvements, a guest blog post, or a new cookbook.

## CLI

We also provide some added CLI functionality for easy convinience:

- `instructor jobs` : This helps with the creation of fine-tuning jobs with OpenAI. Simple use `instructor jobs create-from-file --help` to get started creating your first fine-tuned GPT3.5 model

- `instructor files` : Manage your uploaded files with ease. You'll be able to create, delete and upload files all from the command line

- `instructor usage` : Instead of heading to the OpenAI site each time, you can monitor your usage from the cli and filter by date and time period. Note that usage often takes ~5-10 minutes to update from OpenAI's side
