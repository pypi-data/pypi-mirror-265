- Proper editor for options, that autocompletes file paths and makes it possible
  to delete the whole text with a key.

- If the default value for an option is a list (instead of a string), then
  make it so that it can only take one of those values (the editor that opens
  when selected should be a special one that lets you pick one entry)

- Take care of crashes when the terminal size is too small and/or resized

- Full git_wrapper example (all git subcommands!)

- New example: ffmpeg wrapper. It does not need to be a full wrapper but more a
  guided menu for the more common operations.
