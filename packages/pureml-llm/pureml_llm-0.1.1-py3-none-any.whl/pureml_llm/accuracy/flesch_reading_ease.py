        Calculates the readability of generated outputs using the Flesch Reading
            Ease Score. This metric takes on float values between (-âˆž, 121.22], but
            typically ranges between 0 and 100, where higher scores mean the text is
            easier to read.

            The score is based on the number of sentences, words, and syllables in the
            text. See "How to Write Plain English" by Rudolf Franz Flesch for more
            details.

        Args:
            references (str): The reference text. (also called prompt to LLMs)
            predictions (str): The predicted text. (also called as output of LLMs)
        
            predictions are only used in the computation of readability and references are not used.

        Returns:
            dict : A dictionary containing the readability as key and it's respective score as value.
