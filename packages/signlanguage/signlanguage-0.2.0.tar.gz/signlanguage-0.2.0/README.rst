SignLanguage Recognition Project
================================

SignLanguage is an innovative project created as a graduation thesis for
the University of San Carlos in Guatemala. This project was conceived
solely for study and experimentation purposes by **Jose Wannan**. It
focuses on the fascinating field of sign language recognition, which
plays a crucial role in the communication and inclusion of individuals
with hearing impairments.

SignLanguage is a project designed to facilitate communication between
deaf and hearing individuals by recognizing and translating sign
language gestures. It leverages advanced image processing and machine
learning techniques to achieve this goal.
