# SignLanguage Recognition Project

SignLanguage is a project created as a graduation thesis for the University of San Carlos in Guatemala. This project was created for study and experimentation purposes by **José Wannan**. It consists of the recognition of sign language, which plays a crucial role in the communication and inclusion of people with hearing disabilities.

SignLanguage is a project designed to facilitate communication between deaf and hearing individuals by recognizing and translating sign language gestures. It leverages advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to achieve this goal.
