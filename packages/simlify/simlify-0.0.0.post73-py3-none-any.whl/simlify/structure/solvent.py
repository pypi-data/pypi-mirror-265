    Args:
        sim_context_manager: A simulation context for system preparation.
        charge_net: Total system charge. Will add counter ions if `charge_neutralize`
            is `True` in `sim_context_manager`.
        n_waters: Total number of water molecules in the system.
        water_molecule_volume: Approximate volume of a water molecule in â„«<sup>3</sup>.

    Returns:
        Cations and anions that needs to be added to the system. For example, `2` would
        mean two cations need to be added, but `-2` would mean two anions.
