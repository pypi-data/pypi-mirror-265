Readme
======

``etrsitrs`` is a Python package that implements datum transformations
to and from the ETRF2000 reference frame of the ETRS89 system. It
implements the transformations described in EUREF memo *Specifications
for reference frame fixing in the analysis of a EUREF GPS campaign* by
Boucher and Altamimi (2011).

Requirements
------------

The following packages and tools are required:

numpy
    All computations.

nose
    Running the unit tests.

coverage
    Computing code coverage of the unit tests.

numpydoc
    Building documentation.

sphinx
    Building documentation.

pylint
    Static code analysis (optional).


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is built when running the test suite. Documentation
is also provided pre-built in the following directories:

html
    doc/_build/html/index.html

PDF
    doc/_build/latex/etrsitrs.pdf


Test suite
----------

The test suite is run with the command::

    user@host: ~/etrs-itrs/$ ./run-tests.sh

This requires the ``nose`` and ``coverage`` packages, as well as the
``nosetests`` script. It also builds the documentation and does
static code analysis if ``pylint`` is present.
