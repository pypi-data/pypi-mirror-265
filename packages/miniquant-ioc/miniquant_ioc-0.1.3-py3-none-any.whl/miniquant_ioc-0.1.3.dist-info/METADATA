EPICS IOC for the PicoQuant HydraHarp 400
=========================================

The HydraHarp 400 is [advertized as](https://www.picoquant.com/products/category/tcspc-and-time-tagging-modules/hydraharp-400-multichannel-picosecond-event-timer-tcspc-module)
a "multichannel picosecond event timer module" by its manufacturer,
PicoQuant GmbH in Germany.

This is an [EPICS](https://epics-controls.org/) Input-Output Controller (IOC)
application for the HydraHarp. It uses the [EMMI](https://gitlab.com/codedump2/emmi)
API, which in turn uses [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/)'s EPICS
wrapper [pythonSoftIOC](https://github.com/dls-controls/pythonSoftIOC)
(as of September 2023). This means that miniquant-ioc's EPICS CA stack is
essentially the "original" C/C++ implementation, merely interfaced by Python.

The hardware access layer is being published as
[miniquant](https://pypi.org/project/miniquant/) -- a truly Python'esque :)
API layer on top of the [proprietary HydraHarp API](https://github.com/PicoQuant/HH400-v3.x-Demos)
of PicoQuant, but without the EPICS specific code.


Installation
------------

Miniquant-ioc itself is installed fairly easy via PyPI:
```
pip install miniquant-ioc
```

Or via direct clone from Gitlab:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/codedump2/miniquant-ioc \
    && pip install ./miniquant-ioc
```

If [miniquant](https://pypi.org/project/miniquant/) (the API layer) is not
already installed, it will be automatically pulled from PyPI as a 
dependency of miniquant-ioc. In that case, you will most certainly
have to go through a mildly elaborate set of
[post-install procedures](https://gitlab.com/codedump2/miniquant#installation)
to make sure that miniquant is, in fact, able to find and access your
HydraHarp. (This is owing for one to the proprietary nature of the original
PicoQuant C/C++ API for the HydraHarp, and for another to the fact that
the HydraHarp 400 has a quirky USB controller; it works with any modern upstream
Linux kernel, but requires specialized kernel boot parameter or USB driver module
settings.)
