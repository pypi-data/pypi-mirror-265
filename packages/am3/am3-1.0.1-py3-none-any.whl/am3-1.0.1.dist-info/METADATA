AM3 = Application Manager written with python 3

## 🔧 Installation

Python3 is required, which should be available on most of the modern Linux distributions.

Install am3 with this command:

```bash
pip install am3
```

Then you can use it with `am` or `am3`.

## 📖 (Basic) Usage

```

### Start an application

You can specify command and the params.
