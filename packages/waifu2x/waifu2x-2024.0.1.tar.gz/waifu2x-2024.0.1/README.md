# Waifu2x

<img src="readme-assets/icons/name.png" alt="Project Icon" width="750">

**Python 3.12 is not supported :(**

Waifu2x is an image upscaling and noise reduction algorithm that gained
popularity for its ability to enhance the quality of anime-style images. The
implementation in Chainer, a deep learning framework, uses neural networks
to perform the image enhancement tasks.

## Documentation

A high-level overview of how the documentation is organized organized will help you know
where to look for certain things:

- [Tutorials](/documentation/tutorials) take you by the hand through a series of steps to get
  started using the software. Start here if youâ€™re new.
- The [Technical Reference](/documentation/reference) documents APIs and other aspects of the
  machinery. This documentation describes how to use the classes and functions at a lower level
  and assume that you have a good high-level understanding of the software.
<!--
- The [Help](/documentation/help) guide provides a starting point and outlines common issues that you
  may have.
-->

## Install With PIP

```python
pip install waifu2x
```

Head to https://pypi.org/project/Waifu2x/ for more info

## Language information

### Built for

This program has been written for Python versions 3.8 - 3.11 and has been tested with both 3.8 and
3.11

## Install Python on Windows

### Chocolatey

```powershell
choco install python
```

### Windows - Python.org

To install Python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and download the latest
version.

## Install Python on Linux

### Apt

```bash
sudo apt install python3.x
```

### Dnf

```bash
sudo dnf install python3.x
```

## Install Python on MacOS

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install python@3.x
```

### MacOS - Python.org

To install Python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/ and download the latest
version.

## How to run

### Windows

- Module
	`py -3.x -m [module]` or `[module]` (if module installs a script)

- File
	`py -3.x [file]` or `./[file]`

### Linux/ MacOS

- Module
	`python3.x -m [module]` or `[module]` (if module installs a script)

- File
	`python3.x [file]` or `./[file]`

## Building

This project uses https://github.com/FHPythonUtils/FHMake to automate most of the building. This
command generates the documentation, updates the requirements.txt and builds the library artefacts

Note the functionality provided by fhmake can be approximated by the following

```sh
handsdown  --cleanup -o documentation/reference
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
poetry export -f requirements.txt --with dev --output requirements_optional.txt
poetry build
```

`fhmake audit` can be run to perform additional checks

## Testing

For testing with the version of python used by poetry use

```sh
poetry run pytest
```

Alternatively use `tox` to run tests over python 3.8 - 3.11

```sh
tox
```
