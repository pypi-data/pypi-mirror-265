# flake8-env-patterns

flake8 plugin which validates access to environment variables against allowed patterns

## installation

`pip install flake8-env-patterns`

## flake8 codes

| Code   | Description                                             |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| FEP001 | environment variable does not match any allowed pattern |

## rationale

flake8-env-patterns helps with enforcing a convention for environment variable names when building a python
application.

## configuration

This plugin expects a comma-separated list of regex patterns to validate environment variable access
against.
Patterns can be specified via `--env-variable-patterns` or as part of the flake8 configuration:

```ini
[flake8]
env-variable-patterns = AWS_.*,MYAPP_.*
```
