# Secure Data Management with the Forge Class

This Jupyter notebook provides a walkthrough of using the `Forge` class from the `armr_forge` library, showcasing its capabilities in secure data management tailored for small businesses and serverless computing environments.

## Introduction

The `Forge` class represents a leap forward in managing encrypted data, combining ease of use with robust security features. Designed with small businesses in mind, it offers an accessible yet powerful tool for secure data storage and retrieval.

## Setup

First, ensure you have the `armr_forge` library installed in your environment:

```bash
pip install armr_forge
```

Now, let's import the `Forge` class and initialize it.

```python
from armr_forge import armr_forge
forge = armr_forge.forge()
```

## Creating an Encrypted Database

The `Forge` class simplifies the creation of a secure, encrypted database. Here, we're initializing an empty ARMR file with predefined data categories.

```python
forge.forge_armr("admin", "password", "./documents.armr", "./documents.key", ["type", "name", "owner"])
```

## Establishing a User Session

Security is paramount in the `Forge` class. Let's authenticate with the system to validate our session.

```python
forge.user_session("admin", "password", "./documents.key")
```

## Managing Data

### Adding Data

The `Forge` class supports adding various data types securely. Here, we add a text document as an archived object.

```python
forge.append_objects({"index":{"type":"test","name":"test_name_01","owner":"StalwartBI"},"filepath":r"C:\Users\StalwartBI\test_document.txt"}, "archive")
```

### Querying and Retrieving Data

Efficiently query and retrieve data based on specific criteria.

```python
# Query the database
query_result = forge.query_map([{"field":"%TYPE%","value":"ARCHIVE"}])

# Retrieve a slice of the database
data_slice = forge.retrieve_slice(0, 10)
```

### Extracting Archived Data

Easily access and extract archived files stored within the database.

```python
forge.pull_archive(0, "./test.zip")
```

## Closing the Session

It's crucial to close the session properly to ensure data integrity and clean up temporary resources.

```python
forge.close_armr("./documents.armr")
```

## Conclusion

The `Forge` class offers a comprehensive solution for small businesses and serverless applications, addressing the need for secure and efficient data management. Through this walkthrough, we've explored its core functionalities, from creating an encrypted database to adding, querying, and retrieving data securely.
