However the underlying class base has been changed\nto a vanilla python slots based system - the thinking behind this is in the\nAPI internals documentation. This will change the underlying requirements.\n\nAdditionally at the same time I have converted to Broadworks R24 API schema\nfiles as the basis for generating these classes. This will change the set of\navailable commands and classes.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe class used to be built using Michael DeHaan\'s [`ClassForge`]\n(https://classforge.io/) object system, however from version 2.0.0 it has\nbeen based on vanilla python slotted objects.\n\nDevelopment on the python version was done by\n[Nigel Metheringham `<nigelm@cpan.org>`](https://github.com/nigelm/)\n\nKarol SkibiÅ„ski has been using the package, and has a talent for both finding\nbugs within it and providing a good bug report that allows a test case and fix\nto be made. The package has been immensely improved by this work.\n\nR25 schema update along with some other changes was contributed by\n[@ewurch (Eduardo WÃ¼rch)](https://github.com/ewurch).\n\n---\n',
