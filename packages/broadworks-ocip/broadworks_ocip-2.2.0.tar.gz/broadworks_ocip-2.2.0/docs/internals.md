# Internal Design

The intention was always to have a python class per OCICommand element from
the Broadworks AS schema.

To make this easier the `process_schema.py` program was produced to break
down the Broadworks schema into its component parts, which are represented as
python classes.

The classes are broken down into `types`, `requests` (commands that are sent
to the Broadworks system), and `responses` (the replies back from the
Broadworks system). Unfortunately this means that each of those files is
huge.

The classes themselves are described by a tuple of `ElementInfo` instances -
one per property in the schema class, and a class property for each schema
property. Naming of these is in the more pythonic snake case rather than the
Java-esque CamelCase.

The `ElementInfo` class is used mainly to guide the XML serialisation and
deserialisation of each object. They contain the python and XML names of each
property and some flags about the propery - for example is this a required
element `is_required`, an array like element `is_array`, a tabular set of
data `is_table` or a complex element (ie containing sub-elements)
`is_complex`.

All of the component classes of the system are intended to be immutable.
There are currently no helpers to aid creating a modified instance from an
existing instance because these operations do not appear to be part of a
normal Broadworks workflow.

## Implementation

The `ElementInfo` class was originally a named tuple, but this was changed
later to an [`attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/) based class for speed and to
give some type checking.

The generated classes were all based on Michael DeHaan's[`ClassForge`]
(https://classforge.io/) object system. However although this system fitted
my reuirements very nicely and allowed the `mkdocstrings` auto documentation
to work I was concerned that there were no other packages that used this
system, there have been no updates or releases for well over a year and that
the website had gone defunct. Therefore I moved to another class base.

[`Attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/) mostly worked well as a base for the
classes, but added an approximately 5 second startup cost on a fairly fast
machine. The same occurred with using python's internal `dataclass` - and
also forced a very recent version of python if support for immutable objects
was required.

Therefore the current version is based on a class python objects using a
customised `__init__()` method to set up the attributes from an array of
`ElementInfo` objects. A hack is used to make these objects immutable. The
objects have `__slots__` defined to make them dict-less - although this might
be overkill for the memory and speed benefits. Unfortunately this broke the
`mkdocstrings` documentation (or at least made it take an absolutely _vast_
amount of time to run), so the documentation for the `types`, `requests` and
`responses` is generated statically.

Returned tables (only found in `response` objects), are defined as
`NamedTuple`s with a class name taken from the XML table name, with the
elements within them using names taken from the table definition.

Due to the huge number of component classes, and that they need to have the
session id associated with them on creation (since the objects themselves are
immutable), the `BroadworksAPI` class has a set of helper methods to create and
send the serialised commands to the server and then return the results.

In practice a user only interacts with the `BroadworksAPI` methods.

## Problems

There is no easy way that I can find - especially when autogenerated - to
replicate the XML schema `choice` elements - effectively a union between
different possibilities. As such any element within a `choice` element has
been expressed as a non-required element, and it is up to the library user to
apply appropriate values to make the generated XML work.

As an example of this, look at the `UnboundedPositiveInt` elements within
the usage example, which may have either a positive numeric `quantity` value
or have `unlimited` set true.

Additionally in the example the surrounding `ServicePackAuthorization`
element may have either `unauthorized=True` or `authorized_quantity` set
to a `UnboundedPositiveInt`.

Additionally in version `2.0.1` onwards, schema `sequence` sets, within schema
`choice` elements are similarly handled - all the contained attributes are
made optional.

I can think of some ways to make the currently `xfail` flagged tests in
`test_faulty_command.py` be handled correctly - at the cost of adding more
complexity to the information stored about each command type and making the
`__init__` function more complex. However I am not fully convinced that this
library should be performing that level of input checking - although the
library will accept illegal combinations, the Broadworks server will quickly
tell you that you are wrong!.

The tables returned in many command responses have no type information in the
schema as to how to treat them - the column information is also passed within
the response itself. This means that often there are boolean or numeric
values that are represented as strings. In particular the booleans will have
textual values of either `true` or `false` - all in lower case.
