- **Configurable Notebook Settings**: Instructors can set the JupyterLite service URL and a default notebook.
- **Notebook Tracking**: Tracks learner interactions with notebooks, saving their progress.
- **Interactive Learning**: Offers real-time coding practice and results visualization.
- **Notebook Storage**: Facilitates saving and retrieval of notebooks within the platform.
- **Completion Tracking**: Configurable to mark notebook interactions as course completion criteria.
- **Studio Interface**: Easily manage JupyterLite settings and notebooks in Open edX Studio.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enhanced with custom JavaScript and HTML for an interactive experience.

Now you can access the jupyterlite xblock feature in the advanced component of course unit


#### **Update settings of Jupyter Component**

JupyterLite Xblock will be available in Advanced component of course unit now. Add "JupyterLite" xblock in unit and click "Edit" button
Access Edit Settings: Once the XBlock is added, click on the "Edit" button to open the configuration settings.

#### **Set JupyterLite Service URL:**
In the "JupyterLite base URL" field, enter the URL of your JupyterLite service. This URL is where the JupyterLite server is hosted.
Example: http://jupyterlite.yourservice.com/lab/index.html
This setting defines the base URL for the JupyterLite environment that learners will interact with.

#### **Upload Default Notebook:**
You have the option to upload a default .ipynb (IPython Notebook) file. This notebook will be the starting point for learners.
Click on the "Upload .ipynb file" button and select the desired notebook from your computer.
If a notebook is already uploaded, it will display its name. You can replace it by uploading a new file.

#### **Save the Changes:**
 After configuring the settings, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

#### **Add these settings to enable S3 Storage.**
Please make sure your bucket's CORS allow JupyterLite service URL

    XBLOCK_SETTINGS["JupterLiteXBlock"] = {
        "STORAGE_FUNC": "jupyterlitexblock.storage.s3",
        "S3_BUCKET_NAME": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_GOES_HERE"
    }

#### Completion Delay Setting: 
Configure the delay for marking an activity as complete. The default is 5 seconds, but it can be adjusted to suit course needs. The setting 'completion_delay_seconds' in XBLOCK_SETTINGS allows you to specify the delay in seconds.
```bash
'completion_delay_seconds': self.xblock_settings.get("COMPLETION_DELAY_SECONDS", 5)
```
