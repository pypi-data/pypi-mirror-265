HoloOcean is a high-fidelity simulator for underwater robotics built on top of Unreal Engine 4, and forked from Holodeck by BYU's PCCL Lab.

Do to changes in the Unreal Engine EULA, HoloOcean is no longer released publically via pypi, **however it is still open source and publically avaliable for free via Github once you accept the Unreal EULA.**

__Please go to the official (readthedocs) documentation page for HoloOcean for instructions on the download process.__
