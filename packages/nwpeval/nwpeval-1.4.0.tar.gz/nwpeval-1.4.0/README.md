# NWPeval

NWPeval is a Python package designed to facilitate the evaluation and analysis of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. It provides a comprehensive set of metrics and tools to assess the performance of NWP models by comparing their output with observed weather data.

## Installation

You can install NWPeval using pip:

```shell
pip install nwpeval
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use NWPeval to compute evaluation metrics:

```python
import xarray as xr
from nwpeval import NWPeval

# Load the observed and modeled data
obs_data = xr.open_dataset('observed_data.nc')
model_data = xr.open_dataset('model_data.nc')

# Create an instance of NWPeval
evaluator = NWPeval(obs_data, model_data)

# Compute individual metrics
mae = evaluator.compute_mae()
rmse = evaluator.compute_rmse()
acc = evaluator.compute_acc()

# Compute multiple metrics simultaneously
metrics = ['FSS', 'ETS', 'POD', 'FAR']
thresholds = {'FSS': 0.5, 'ETS': 0.7, 'POD': 0.6, 'FAR': 0.3}
results = evaluator.compute_metrics(metrics, dim=['lat', 'lon'], thresholds=thresholds)
```
