# pressio-linalg

Install with
```
pip install pressio-linalg
```

This installs the library such that all kernels are implemented with pure python calls and calls to MPI.
Therefore, all the communication is handled explicitly internally and we do not rely on any external backend.

## Installation

`pressio-linalg` is tested on Python 3.8-3.11.

To install, use the following command:

```
pip install pressio-linalg
```

With this installation, all kernels are implemented with pure Python calls and calls to MPI. This ensures that all the communication is handled explicitly internally and we do not rely on any external backend.
