# remotemanager

Modular serialisation and management package for handling the running of functions on remote machines

Based off of the BigDFT RemoteRunner concept, remotemanager represents an improvement and expansion on the concepts based there.

Primary usage is via a `Dataset`, which connects to a remote machine via `URL`

You can think of the `Dataset` as a "container" of sorts for a calculation, to which "runs" are attached. These runs are then executed on the remote machine described by the provided `URL`

### Installation

A quick install of the latest stable release can be done via `pip install remotemanager`

For development, you can clone this repo and install via `cd remotemanager && pip install -e .[dev]`

Tip: You can clone a specific branch with `git clone -b devel`.

If you want to build the docs locally a `pandoc` install is required. 

You can install all required python packages with the `[dev]` or `[docs]` optionals. 

### HPC

Remotemanager exists to facilitate running on High Performance Compute machines (supercomputers). Script generation is ideally done via the `BaseComputer` module.

Existing Computers can be found at [this repository](https://gitlab.com/l_sim/remotemanager-computers). For creating a new machine class, see the [documentation](https://l_sim.gitlab.io/remotemanager/).

### Documentation

See the [documentation](https://l_sim.gitlab.io/remotemanager/) for further information, tutorials and api documentation.
