# XNAT helper functions

Simple set of XNAT helper functions targeted at Nottingham applications. These 
functions were originally built in to various XNAT applications where they 
acquired fixes and code aimed to work around XNAT oddities. It seemed best to 
merge these into a combined set of helpers that can be re-used in different projects

# To do

Could make functions into an object but might reduce flexibility
