-Chapter 
-
-Water is softest and most yielding substance.
-Yet nothis better than water,
-for overng the hard and rigid,
-because ing can compete with it.
-Everyonews that the soft and yielding
-overcomee rigid and hard,
-but few put this knowledge into practice.
-Therefore Master says:
-"Only he is the lowest servant of the kingdom,
-is worth become its ruler.
-He who illing tackle the most unpleasant tasks,

-True say seem contradictory.
-
-Chapter 
-
-Difficul remain, even after solving a problem.
-How then we consider that as good?
-Therefore Master
-does whae knows is right,
-and make demands of others.
-A virtuoerson will do the right thing,

-Chapter 
-
-True woro not sound beautiful;
-beautifuunding words are not true.
-Wise men't need to debate;
-men who  to debate are not wise.
-Wise men not scholars,
-and scho are not wise.
-The Mastesires no possessions.
-Since things she does are for the people,
-she has  than she needs.
-The more gives to others,
-the more has for herself.
-The Tao eaven nourishes by not forcing.
-The Tao he Wise person acts by not competing.
+The tao that can be described
+is not the eternal Tao.
+The name that can be spoken
+is not the eternal Name.
+The nameless is the boundary of Heaven and Earth.
+The named is the mother of creation.
+Freed from desire, you can see the hidden mystery.
+By having desire, you can only see what is visibly real.
+Yet mystery and reality
+emerge from the same source.
+This source is called darkness.
+Darkness born from darkness.
+The beginning of all understanding.
+
+Chapter 2
+
+When people see things as beautiful,
+ugliness is created.
+When people see things as good,
+evil is created.
+Being and non-being produce each other.
+Difficult and easy complement each other.
+Long and short define each other.
+High and low oppose each other.
+Fore and aft follow each other.
+Therefore the Master
+can act without doing anything
+and teach without saying a word.
+Things come her way and she does not stop them;
+things leave and she lets them go.
+She has without possessing,
+and acts without any expectations.
+When her work is done, she takes no credit.
+That is why it will last forever.
+
+Chapter 3
+
+If you overly esteem talented individuals,
+people will become overly competitive.
+If you overvalue possessions,
+people will begin to steal.
+Do not display your treasures
+or people will become envious.
+The Master leads by
+emptying people's minds;
+filling their bellies,
+weakening their ambitions,
+and making them become strong.
+Preferring simplicity and freedom from desires,
+avoiding the pitfalls of knowledge and wrong action.
+For those who practice not-doing,
+everything will fall into place.
+
+Chapter 4
+
+The Tao is like an empty container:
+it can never be emptied and can never be filled.
+Infinitely deep, it is the source of all things.
+It dulls the sharp, unties the knotted,
+shades the lighted, and unites all of creation with dust.
+It is hidden but always present.
+I don't know who gave birth to it .
+It is older than the concept of God.
+
+Chapter 5
+
+Heaven and Earth are impartial;
+they treat all of creation as straw dogs.
+The Master doesn't take sides;
+she treats everyone like a straw dog.
+The space between Heaven and Earth is like a bellows;
+it is empty, yet has not lost its power.
+The more it is used, the more it produces;
+the more you talk of it, the less you comprehend.
+It is better not to speak of things you do not understand.
+
+Chapter 6
+
+The spirit of emptiness is immortal.
+It is called the Great Mother
+because it gives birth to Heaven and Earth.
+It is like a vapor,
+barely seen but always present.
+Use it effortlessly.
+
+Chapter 7
+
+The Tao of Heaven is eternal,
+and the earth is long enduring.
+Why are they long enduring?
+They do not live for themselves;
+thus they are present for all beings.
+The Master puts herself last;
+And finds herself in the place of authority.
+She detaches herself from all things;
+Therefore she is united with all things.
+She gives no thought to self.
+She is perfectly fulfilled.
+
+Chapter 8
+
+The supreme good is like water,
+which benefits all of creation
+without trying to compete with it.
+It gathers in unpopular places.
+Thus it is like the Tao.
+The location makes the dwelling good.
+Depth of understanding makes the mind good.
+A kind heart makes the giving good.
+Integrity makes the government good.
+Accomplishments make your labors good.
+Proper timing makes a decision good.
+Only when there is no competition
+will we all live in peace.
+
+Chapter 9
+
+It is easier to carry an empty cup
+than one that is filled to the brim.
+The sharper the knife
+the easier it is to dull.
+The more wealth you possess
+the harder it is to protect.
+Pride brings it's own trouble.
+When you have accomplished your goal
+simply walk away.
+This is the pathway to Heaven.
+
+Chapter 10
+
+Nurture the darkness of your soul
+until you become whole.
+Can you do this and not fail?
+Can you focus your life-breath until you become
+supple as a newborn child?
+While you cleanse your inner vision
+will you be found without fault?
+Can you love people and lead them
+without forcing your will on them?
+When Heaven gives and takes away
+can you be content with the outcome?
+When you understand all things
+can you step back from your own understanding?
+Giving birth and nourishing,
+making without possessing,
+expecting nothing in return.
+To grow, yet not to control:
+This is the mysterious virtue.
+
+Chapter 11
+
+Thirty spokes are joined together in a wheel,
+but it is the center hole
+that allows the wheel to function.
+We mold clay into a pot,
+but it is the emptiness inside
+that makes the vessel useful.
+We fashion wood for a house,
+but it is the emptiness inside
+that makes it livable.
+We work with the substantial,
+but the emptiness is what we use.
+
+Chapter 12
+
+Five colors blind the eye.
+Five notes deafen the ear.
+Five flavors make the palate go stale.
+Too much activity deranges the mind.
+Too much wealth causes crime.
+The Master acts on what she feels and not what she sees.
+She shuns the latter, and prefers to seek the former.
+
+Chapter 13
+
+Success is as dangerous as failure,
+and we are often our own worst enemy.
+What does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure?
+He who is superior is also someone's subordinate.
+Receiving favor and loosing it both cause alarm.
+That is what is meant by success is as dangerous as failure.
+What does it mean that we are often our own worst enemy?
+The reason I have an enemy is because I have "self".
+If I no longer had a "self", I would no longer have an enemy.
+Love the whole world as if it were your self;
+then you will truly care for all things.
+
+Chapter 14
+
+Look for it, and it can't be seen.
+Listen for it, and it can't be heard.
+Grasp for it, and it can't be caught.
+These three cannot be further described,
+so we treat them as The One.
+It's highest is not bright.
+It's depths are not dark.
+Unending, unnameable, it returns to nothingness.
+Formless forms, and image less images,
+subtle, beyond all understanding.
+Approach it and you will not see a beginning;
+follow it and there will be no end.
+When we grasp the Tao of the ancient ones,
+we can use it to direct our life today.
+To know the ancient origin of Tao:
+this is the beginning of wisdom.
+
+
+Chapter 15
+
+The Sages of old were profound
+and knew the ways of subtlety and discernment.
+Their wisdom is beyond our comprehension.
+Because their knowledge was so far superior
+I can only give a poor description.
+They were careful
+as someone crossing an frozen stream in winter.
+Alert as if surrounded on all sides by the enemy.
+Courteous as a guest.
+Fluid as melting ice.
+Whole as an uncarved block of wood.
+Receptive as a valley.
+Turbid as muddied water.
+Who can be still
+until their mud settles
+and the water is cleared by itself?
+Can you remain tranquil until right action occurs by itself?
+The Master doesn't seek fulfillment.
+For only those who are not full are able to be used
+which brings the feeling of completeness.
+
+Chapter 16
+
+If you can empty your mind of all thoughts
+your heart will embrace the tranquility of peace.
+Watch the workings of all of creation,
+but contemplate their return to the source.
+All creatures in the universe
+return to the point where they began.
+Returning to the source is tranquility
+because we submit to Heavens mandate.
+Returning to Heavens mandate is called being constant.
+Knowing the constant is called 'enlightenment'.
+Not knowing the constant is the source of evil deeds
+because we have no roots.
+By knowing the constant we can accept things as they are.
+By accepting things as they are, we become impartial.
+By being impartial, we become one with Heaven.
+By being one with Heaven, we become one with Tao.
+Being one with Tao, we are no longer concerned about
+loosing our life because we know the Tao is constant
+and we are one with Tao.
+Chapter17
+
+The best leaders are those the people hardly know exist.
+The next best is a leader who is loved and praised.
+Next comes the one who is feared.
+The worst one is the leader that is despised.
+If you don't trust the people,
+they will become untrustworthy.
+The best leaders value their words, and use them sparingly.
+When she has accomplished her task,
+the people say, "Amazing:
+we did it, all by ourselves!"
+Chapter18
+
+When the great Tao is abandoned,
+charity and righteousness appear.
+When intellectualism arises,
+hypocrisy is close behind.
+When there is strife in the family unit,
+people talk about 'brotherly love'.
+When the country falls into chaos,
+politicians talk about 'patriotism'.
+
+
+Chapter 19
+
+Forget about knowledge and wisdom,
+and people will be a hundred times better off.
+Throw away charity and righteousness,
+and people will return to brotherly love.
+Throw away profit and greed,
+and there won't be any thieves.
+These three are superficial and aren't enough
+to keep us at the center of the circle, so we must also:
+Embrace simplicity.
+Put others first.
+Desire little.
+
+
+Chapter 20
+
+Renounce knowledge and your problems will end.
+What is the difference between yes and no?
+What is the difference between good and evil?
+Must you fear what others fear?
+Nonsense, look how far you have missed the mark!
+Other people are joyous,
+as though they were at a spring festival.
+I alone am unconcerned and expressionless,
+like an infant before it has learned to smile.
+Other people have more than they need;
+I alone seem to possess nothing.
+I am lost and drift about with no place to go.
+I am like a fool; my mind is in chaos.
+Ordinary people are bright;
+I alone am dark.
+Ordinary people are clever;
+I alone am dull.
+Ordinary people seem discriminating;
+I alone am muddled and confused.
+I drift on the waves on the ocean,
+blown at the mercy of the wind.
+Other people have their goals,
+I alone am dull and uncouth.
+I am different from ordinary people.
+I nurse from the Great Mother's breasts.
+
+Chapter 21
+
+The greatest virtue you can have
+comes from following only the Tao;
+which takes a form that is intangible and evasive.
+Even though the Tao is intangible and evasive,
+we are able to know it exists.
+Intangible and evasive, yet it has a manifestation.
+Secluded and dark, yet there is a vitality within it.
+Its vitality is very genuine.
+Within it we can find order.
+Since the beginning of time, the Tao has always existed.
+It is beyond existing and not existing.
+How do I know where creation comes from?
+I look inside myself and see it.
+
+Chapter 22
+
+If you want to become whole,
+first let yourself become broken.
+If you want to become straight,
+first let yourself become twisted.
+If you want to become full,
+first let yourself become empty.
+If you want to become new,
+first let yourself become old.
+Those whose desires are few gets them,
+those whose desires are great go astray.
+For this reason the Master embraces the Tao,
+as an example for the world to follow.
+Because she isn't self centered,
+people can see the light in her.
+Because she does not boast of herself,
+she becomes a shining example.
+Because she does not glorify herself,
+she becomes a person of merit.
+Because she wants nothing from the world,
+the world cannot overcome her.
+When the ancient Masters said,
+"If you want to become whole,
+then first let yourself be broken,"
+they weren't using empty words.
+All who do this will be made complete.
+
+Chapter 23
+
+Nature uses few words:
+when the gale blows, it will not last long;
+when it rains hard, it lasts but a little while;
+What causes these to happen? Heaven and Earth.
+Why do we humans go on endlessly about little
+when nature does much in a little time?
+If you open yourself to the Tao,
+you and Tao become one.
+If you open yourself to Virtue,
+then you can become virtuous.
+If you open yourself to loss,
+then you will become lost.
+If you open yourself to the Tao,
+the Tao will eagerly welcome you.
+If you open yourself to virtue,
+virtue will become a part of you.
+If you open yourself to loss,
+the lost are glad to see you.
+"When you do not trust people,
+people will become untrustworthy."
+
+Chapter 24
+
+Those who stand on tiptoes
+do not stand firmly.
+Those who rush ahead
+don't get very far.
+Those who try to out shine others
+dim their own light.
+Those who call themselves righteous
+can't know how wrong they are.
+Those who boast of their accomplishments
+diminishes the things they have done.
+Compared to the Tao, these actions are unworthy. If we are to follow the Tao,
+we must not do these things.
+
+Chapter 25
+
+Before the universe was born
+there was something in the chaos of the heavens.
+It stands alone and empty,
+solitary and unchanging.
+It is ever present and secure.
+It may be regarded as the Mother of the universe.
+Because I do not know it's name,
+I call it the Tao.
+If forced to give it a name,
+I would call it 'Great'.
+Because it is Great means it is everywhere.
+Being everywhere means it is eternal.
+Being eternal means everything returns to it.
+Tao is great.
+Heaven is great.
+Earth is great.
+Humanity is great.
+Within the universe, these are the four great things.
+Humanity follows the earth.
+Earth follows Heaven.
+Heaven follows the Tao.
+The Tao follows only itself.
+
+Chapter 26
+
+Heaviness is the basis of lightness.
+Stillness is the standard of activity.
+Thus the Master travels all day
+without ever leaving her wagon.
+Even though she has much to see,
+is she at peace in her indifference.
+Why should the lord of a thousand chariots
+be amused at the foolishness of the world?
+If you abandon yourself to foolishness,
+you lose touch with your beginnings.
+If you let yourself become distracted,
+you will lose the basis of your power.
+
+Chapter 27
+
+A good traveler leaves no tracks,
+and a skillful speaker is well rehearsed.
+A good bookkeeper has an excellent memory,
+and a well-made door is easy to open and needs no locks.
+A good knot needs no rope and it cannot come undone.
+Thus the Master is willing to help everyone,
+and doesn't know the meaning of rejection.
+She is there to help all of creation,
+and doesn't abandon even the smallest creature.
+This is called embracing the light.
+What is a good person but a bad person's teacher?
+What is a bad person but raw materiel for his teacher?
+If you fail to honor your teacher or fail to enjoy your student,
+you will become deluded no matter how smart you are.
+It is the secret of prime importance.
+
+Chapter 28
+
+Know the masculine,
+but keep to the feminine:
+and become a watershed to the world.
+If you embrace the world,
+the Tao will never leave you
+and you become as a little child.
+Know the white,
+yet keep to the black:
+be a model for the world.
+If you are a model for the world,
+the Tao inside you will strengthen
+and you will return whole to your eternal beginning.
+Know the honorable,
+but do not shun the disgraced:
+embracing the world as it is.
+If you embrace the world with compassion,
+then your virtue will return you to the uncarved block.
+The block of wood is carved into utensils
+by carving void into the wood.
+The Master uses the utensils, yet prefers to keep to the block
+because of its limitless possibilities.
+Great works do not involve discarding substance.
+
+Chapter 29
+
+Do you want to rule the world and control it?
+I don't think it can ever be done.
+The world is sacred vessel
+and it cannot be controlled.
+You will only it make it worse if you try.
+It may slip through your fingers and disappear.
+Some are meant to lead,
+and others are meant to follow;
+Some must always strain,
+and others have an easy time;
+Some are naturally big and strong,
+and others will always be small;
+Some will be protected and nurtured,
+and others will meet with destruction.
+The Master accepts things as they are,
+and out of compassion avoids extravagance
+, excess and the extremes.
+
+Chapter 30
+
+Those who lead people by following the Tao
+don't use weapons to enforce their will.
+Using force always leads to unseen troubles.
+In the places where armies march,
+thorns and briars bloom and grow.
+After armies take to war,
+bad years must always follow.
+The skillful commander
+strikes a decisive blow then stops.
+When victory is won over the enemy through war
+it is not a thing of great pride.
+When the battle is over,
+arrogance is the new enemy.
+War can result when no other alternative is given,
+so the one who overcomes an enemy should not dominate them.
+The strong always weakened with time.
+This is not the way of the Tao.
+That which is not of the Tao will soon end.
+
+Chapter 31
+
+Weapons are the bearers of bad news;
+all people should detest them.
+The wise man values the left side,
+and in time of war he values the right.
+Weapons are meant for destruction,
+and thus are avoided by the wise.
+Only as a last resort
+will a wise person use a deadly weapon.
+If peace is her true objective
+how can she rejoice in the victory of war?
+Those who rejoice in victory
+delight in the slaughter of humanity.
+Those who resort to violence
+will never bring peace to the world.
+The left side is a place of honor on happy occasions.
+The right side is reserved for mourning at a funeral.
+When the lieutenants take the left side to prepare for war,
+the general should be on the right side,
+because he knows the outcome will be death.
+The death of many should be greeted with great sorrow,
+and the victory celebration should honor those who have died.
+
+
+Chapter 32
+
+The Tao is nameless and unchanging.
+Although it appears insignificant,
+nothing in the world can contain it.
+If a ruler abides by its principles,
+then her people will willingly follow.
+Heaven would then reign on earth,
+like sweet rain falling on paradise.
+People would have no need for laws,
+because the law would be written on their hearts.
+Naming is a necessity for order,
+but naming cannot order all things.
+Naming often makes things impersonal,
+so we should know when naming should end.
+Knowing when to stop naming,
+you can avoid the pitfall it brings.
+All things end in the Tao
+just as the small streams and the largest rivers
+flow through valleys to the sea.
+
+Chapter 33
+
+Those who know others are intelligent;
+those who know themselves are truly wise.
+Those who master others are strong;
+those who master themselves have true power.
+Those who know they have enough are truly wealthy.
+Those who persist will reach their goal.
+Those who keep their course have a strong will.
+Those who embrace death will not perish,
+but have life everlasting.
+
+Chapter 34
+
+The great Tao flows unobstructed in every direction.
+All things rely on it to conceive and be born,
+and it does not deny even the smallest of creation.
+When it has accomplishes great wonders,
+it does not claim them for itself.
+It nourishes infinite worlds,
+yet it doesn't seek to master the smallest creature.
+Since it is without wants and desires,
+it can be considered humble.
+All of creation seeks it for refuge
+yet it does not seek to master or control.
+Because it does not seek greatness;
+it is able to accomplish truly great things.
+
+Chapter 35
+
+She who follows the way of the Tao
+will draw the world to her steps.
+She can go without fear of being injured,
+because she has found peace and tranquility in her heart.
+Where there is music and good food,
+people will stop to enjoy it.
+But words spoken of the Tao
+seem to them boring and stale.
+When looked at, there is nothing for them to see.
+When listen for, there is nothing for them to hear.
+Yet if they put it to use, it would never be exhausted.
+
+Chapter 36
+
+If you want something to return to the source,
+you must first allow it to spread out.
+If you want something to weaken,
+you must first allow it to become strong.
+If you want something to be removed,
+you must first allow it to flourish.
+If you want to possess something,
+you must first give it away.
+This is called the subtle understanding
+of how things are meant to be.
+The soft and pliable overcomes the hard and inflexible.
+Just as fish remain hidden in deep waters,
+it is best to keep weapons out of sight.
+
+Chapter 37
+
+The Tao never acts with force,
+yet there is nothing that it cannot do.
+If rulers could follow the way of the Tao,
+then all of creation would willingly follow their example.
+If selfish desires were to arise after their transformation,
+I would erase them with the power of the Uncarved Block.
+By the power of the Uncarved Block,
+future generations would loose their selfish desires.
+By loosing their selfish desires,
+the world would naturally settle into peace.
+
+Chapter 38
+
+The highest good is not to seek to do good,
+but to allow yourself to become it.
+The ordinary person seeks to do good things,
+and finds that they cannot do them continually.
+The Master does not force virtue on others,
+thus she is able to accomplish her task.
+The ordinary person who uses force,
+will find that they accomplish nothing.
+The kind person acts from the heart,
+and accomplishes a multitude of things.
+The righteous person acts out of pity,
+yet leaves many things undone.
+The moral person will act out of duty,
+and when no one will respond
+will roll up his sleeves and uses force.
+When the Tao is forgotten, there is righteousness.
+When righteousness is forgotten, there is morality.
+When morality is forgotten, there is the law.
+The law is the husk of faith,
+and trust is the beginning of chaos.
+Our basic understandings are not from the Tao
+because they come from the depths of our misunderstanding.
+The master abides in the fruit and not in the husk.
+She dwells in the Tao,
+and not with the things that hide it.
+This is how she increases in wisdom.
+
+Chapter 39
+
+The masters of old attained unity with the Tao.
+Heaven attained unity and become pure.
+The earth attained unity and found peace.
+The spirits attained unity so they could minister.
+The valleys attained unity that they might be full.
+Humanity attained unity that they might flourish.
+Their leaders attained unity that they might set the example.
+This is the power of unity.
+Without unity, the sky becomes filthy.
+Without unity, the earth becomes unstable.
+Without unity, the spirits become unresponsive and disappear.
+Without unity, the valleys become dry as a desert.
+Without unity, human kind can't reproduce and becomes extinct.
+Without unity, our leaders become corrupt and fall.
+The great view the small as their source,
+and the high takes the low as their foundation.
+Their greatest asset becomes their humility.
+They speak of themselves as orphans and widows,
+thus they truly seek humility.
+Do not shine like the precious gem,
+but be as dull as a common stone.
+
+Chapter 40
+
+All movement returns to the Tao.
+Weakness is how the Tao works.
+All of creation is born from substance.
+Substance is born of nothing-ness.
+
+Chapter 41
+
+When a superior person hears of the Tao,
+She diligently puts it into practice.
+When an average person hears of the Tao,
+he believes half of it, and doubts the other half.
+When a foolish person hears of the Tao,
+he laughs out loud at the very idea.
+If he didn't laugh,
+it wouldn't be the Tao.
+Thus it is said:
+The brightness of the Tao seems like darkness,
+the advancement of the Tao seems like retreat,
+the level path seems rough,
+the superior path seem empty,
+the pure seems to be tarnished,
+and true virtue doesn't seem to be enough.
+The virtue of caution seems like cowardice,
+the pure seems to be polluted,
+the true square seems to have no corners,
+the best vessels take the most time to finish,
+the greatest sounds cannot be heard,
+and the greatest image has no form.
+The Tao hides in the unnamed,
+Yet it alone nourishes and completes all things.
+
+Chapter 42
+
+The Tao gave birth to One.
+The One gave birth to Two.
+The Two gave birth to Three.
+The Three gave birth to all of creation.
+All things carry Yin
+yet embrace Yang.
+They blend their life breaths
+in order to produce harmony.
+People despise being orphaned, widowed and poor.
+But the noble ones take these as their titles.
+In loosing, much is gained,
+and in gaining, much is lost.
+What others teach I too will teach:
+"The strong and violent will not die a natural death."
+
+Chapter 43
+
+That which offers no resistance,
+overcomes the hardest substances.
+That which offers no resistance
+can enter where there is no space.
+Few in the world can comprehend
+the teaching without words,
+or understand the value of non-action.
+
+Chapter 44
+
+Which is more important, your honor or your life?
+Which is more valuable, your possessions or your person?
+Which is more destructive, success or failure?
+Because of this, great love extracts a great cost
+and true wealth requires greater loss.
+Knowing when you have enough avoids dishonor,
+and knowing when to stop will keep you from danger
+and bring you a long, happy life.
+
+Chapter 45
+
+The greatest accomplishments seem imperfect,
+yet their usefulness is not diminished.
+The greatest fullness seems empty,
+yet it will be inexhaustible.
+The greatest straightness seems crooked.
+The most valued skill seems like clumsiness.
+The greatest speech seems full of stammers.
+Movement overcomes the cold,
+and stillness overcomes the heat.
+That which is pure and still is the universal ideal.
+
+Chapter 46
+
+When the world follows the Tao,
+horses run free to fertilize the fields.
+When the world does not follow the Tao,
+war horses are bread outside the cities.
+There is no greater transgression
+than condoning peoples selfish desires,
+no greater disaster than being discontent,
+and no greater retribution than for greed.
+Whoever knows contentment will be at peace forever.
+
+
+Chapter 47
+
+Without opening your door,
+you can know the whole world.
+Without looking out your window,
+you can understand the way of the Tao.
+The more knowledge you seek,
+the less you will understand.
+The Master understands without leaving,
+sees clearly without looking,
+accomplishes much without doing anything.
+
+Chapter 48
+
+One who seeks knowledge learns something new every day.
+One who seeks the Tao unlearns something new every day.
+Less and less remains until you arrive at non-action.
+When you arrive at non-action,
+nothing will be left undone.
+Mastery of the world is achieved
+by letting things take their natural course.
+You cannot master the world by changing the natural way.
+
+Chapter 49
+
+The Master has no mind of her own.
+She understands the mind of the people.
+To those who are good she treats as good.
+To those who aren't good she also treats as good.
+This is how she attains true goodness.
+She trusts people who are trustworthy.
+She also trusts people who aren't trustworthy.
+This is how she gains true trust.
+The Master's mind is shut off from the world.
+Only for the sake of the people does she muddle her mind.
+They look to her in anticipation.
+Yet she treats them all as her children.
+
+Chapter 50
+
+Those who leave the womb at birth
+and those who enter their source at death,
+of these; three out of ten celebrate life,
+three out of ten celebrate death,
+and three out of ten simply go from life to death.
+What is the reason for this?
+Because they are afraid of dying,
+therefore they cannot live.
+I have heard that those who celebrate life
+walk safely among the wild animals.
+When they go into battle, they remain unharmed.
+The animals find no place to attack them
+and the weapons are unable to harm them.
+Why? Because they can find no place for death in them.
+
+Chapter 51
+
+The Tao gives birth to all of creation.
+The virtue of Tao in nature nurtures them,
+and their family give them their form.
+Their environment then shapes them into completion.
+That is why every creature honors the Tao and its virtue.
+No one tells them to honor the Tao and its virtue,
+it happens all by itself.
+So the Tao gives them birth,
+and its virtue cultivates them,
+cares for them,
+nurtures them,
+gives them a place of refuge and peace,
+helps them to grow and shelters them.
+It gives them life without wanting to posses them,
+and cares for them expecting nothing in return.
+It is their master, but it does not seek to dominate them.
+This is called the dark and mysterious virtue.
+
+Chapter 52
+
+The world had a beginning
+which we call the Great Mother.
+Once we have found the Mother,
+we begin to k2now what Her children should be.
+When we know we are the Mothers child,
+we begin to guard the qualities of the Mother in us.
+She will protect us from all danger
+even if we lose our life.
+Keep your mouth closed
+and embrace a simple life,
+and you will live care-free until the end of your days.
+If you try to talk your way into a better life
+there will be no end to your trouble.
+To understand the small is called clarity.
+Knowing how to yield is called strength.
+To use your inner light for understanding
+regardless of the danger
+is called depending on the Constant.
+
+Chapter 53
+
+If I understood only one thing,
+I would want to use it to follow the Tao.
+My only fear would be one of pride.
+The Tao goes in the level places,
+but people prefer to take the short cuts.
+If too much time is spent cleaning the house
+the land will become neglected and full of weeds,
+and the granaries will soon become empty
+because there is no one out working the fields.
+To wear fancy clothes and ornaments,
+to have your fill of food and drink
+and to waste all of your money buying possessions
+is called the crime of excess.
+Oh, how these things go against the way of the Tao!
+
+Chapter 54
+
+That which is well built
+will never be torn down.
+That which is well latched
+cannot slip away.
+Those who do things well
+will be honored from generation to generation.
+If this idea is cultivated in the individual,
+then his virtue will become genuine.
+If this idea is cultivated in your family,
+then virtue in your family will be great.
+If this idea is cultivated in your community,
+then virtue will go a long way.
+If this idea is cultivated in your country,
+then virtue will be in many places.
+If this idea is cultivated in the world,
+then virtue will be with everyone.
+Then observe the person for what the person does,
+and observe the family for what it does,
+and observe the community for what it does,
+and observe the country for what it does,
+and observe the world for what it does.
+How do I know this saying is true?
+I observe these things and see.
+
+Chapter 55
+
+One who is filled with the Tao
+is like a newborn child.
+The infant is protected from
+the stinging insects, wild beasts, and birds of prey.
+Its bones are soft, its muscles are weak,
+but its grip is firm and strong.
+It doesn't know about the union
+of male and female,
+yet his penis can stand erect,
+because of the power of life within him.
+It can cry all day and never become hoarse.
+This is perfect harmony.
+To understand harmony is to understand the Constant.
+To know the Constant is to be called 'enlightened'.
+To unnaturally try to extend life is not appropriate.
+To try and alter the life-breath is unnatural.
+The master understands that when something reaches its prime
+it will soon begin to decline.
+Changing the natural is against the way of the Tao.
+Those who do it will come to an early end.
+
+Chapter 56
+
+Those who know do not talk.
+Those who talk do not know.
+Stop talking,
+meditate in silence,
+blunt your sharpness,
+release your worries,
+harmonize your inner light,
+and become one with the dust.
+Doing this is the called the dark and mysterious identity.
+Those who have achieved the mysterious identity
+cannot be approached, and they cannot be alienated.
+They cannot be benefited nor harmed.
+They cannot be made noble nor to suffer disgrace.
+This makes them the most noble of all under the heavens.
+
+Chapter 57
+
+Govern your country with integrity,
+Weapons of war can be used with great cunning,
+but loyalty is only won by not-doing.
+How do I know the way things are?
+By these:
+The more prohibitions you make,
+the poorer people will be.
+The more weapons you posses,
+the greater the chaos in your country.
+The more knowledge that is acquired,
+the stranger the world will become.
+The more laws that you make,
+the greater the number of criminals.
+Therefore the Master says:
+I do nothing,
+and people become good by themselves.
+I seek peace,
+and people take care of their own problems.
+I do not meddle in their personal lives,
+and the people become prosperous.
+I let go of all my desires,
+and the people return to the Uncarved Block.
+
+Chapter 58
+
+If a government is unobtrusive,
+the people become whole.
+If a government is repressive,
+the people become treacherous.
+Good fortune has its roots in disaster,
+and disaster lurks with good fortune.
+Who knows why these things happen,
+or when this cycle will end?
+Good things seem to change into bad,
+and bad things often turn out for good.
+These things have always been hard to comprehend.
+Thus the Master makes things change
+without interfering.
+She is probing yet causes no harm.
+Straightforward, yet does not impose her will.
+Radiant, and easy on the eye.
+
+Chapter 59
+
+There is nothing better than moderation
+for teaching people or serving Heaven.
+Those who use moderation
+are already on the path to the Tao.
+Those who follow the Tao early
+will have an abundance of virtue.
+When there is an abundance of virtue,
+there is nothing that cannot be done.
+Where there is limitless ability,
+then the kingdom is withing your grasp.
+When you know the Mother of the kingdom,
+then you will be long enduring.
+This is spoken of as the deep root and the firm trunk,
+the Way to a long life and great spiritual vision.
+
+Chapter 60
+
+Governing a large country
+is like frying small fish.
+Too much poking spoils the meat.
+When the Tao is used to govern the world
+then evil will loose its power to harm the people.
+Not that evil will no longer exist,
+but only because it has lost its power.
+Just as evil can loose its ability to harm,
+the Master shuns the use of violence.
+If you give evil nothing to oppose,
+then virtue will return by itself.
+
+Chapter 61
+
+A large country should take the low place like a great watershed,
+which from its low position assumes the female role.
+The female overcomes the male by the power of her position.
+Her tranquility gives rise to her humility.
+If a large country takes the low position,
+it will be able to influence smaller countries.
+If smaller countries take the lower position,
+then they can allow themselves to be influenced.
+So both seek to take the lower position
+in order to influence the other, or be influenced.
+Large countries should desire to protect and help the people,
+and small countries should desire to serve others.
+Both large and small countries benefit greatly from humility.
+
+Chapter 62
+
+The Tao is the tabernacle of creation;
+it is a treasure for those who are good,
+and a place of refuge for those who are not.
+How can those who are not good be abandoned?
+Words that are beautiful are worth much,
+but good behavior can only be learned by example.
+When a new leader takes office,
+don't give him gifts and offerings.
+These things are not as valuable
+as teaching him about the Tao.
+Why was the Tao esteemed by the ancient Masters?
+Is it not said: "With it we find without looking.
+With it we find forgiveness for our transgressions."
+That is why the world cannot under stand it.
+
+Chapter 63
+
+Act by not acting;
+do by not doing.
+Enjoy the plain and simple.
+Find that greatness in the small.
+Take care of difficult problems
+while they are still easy;
+Do easy things before they become too hard.
+Difficult problems are best solved while they are easy.
+Great projects are best started while they are small.
+The Master never takes on more than she can handle,
+which means that she leaves nothing undone.
+When an affirmation is given too lightly,
+keep your eyes open for trouble ahead.
+When something seems too easy,
+difficulty is hiding in the details.
+The master expects great difficulty,
+so the task is always easier than planned.
+
+Chapter 64

+Things are easier to control while things are quiet.
+Things are easier to plan far in advance.
+Things break easier while they are still brittle.
+Things are easier hid while they are still small.
+Prevent problems before they arise.
+Take action before things get out of hand.
+The tallest tree
+begins as a tiny sprout.
+The tallest building
+starts with one shovel of dirt.
+A journey of a thousand miles
+starts with a single foot step.
+If you rush into action, you will fail.
+If you hold on too tight, you will loose your grip.
+Therefore the Master lets things take their course
+and thus never fails.
+She doesn't hold on to things
+and never looses them.
+By pursing your goals too relentlessly,
+you let them slip away.
+If you are as concerned about the outcome
+as you are about the beginning,
+then it is hard to do things wrong.
+The master seeks no possessions.
+She learns by unlearning,
+thus she is able to understand all things.
+This gives her the ability to help all of creation.
+
+Chapter 65
+
+The ancient Masters
+who understood the way of the Tao,
+did not educate people, but made them forget.
+Smart people are difficult to guide,
+because they think they are too clever.
+To use cleverness to rule a country,
+is to lead the country to ruin.
+To avoid cleverness in ruling a country,
+is to lead the country to prosperity.
+Knowing the two alternatives is a pattern.
+Remaining aware of the pattern is a virtue.
+This dark and mysterious virtue is profound.
+It is opposite our natural inclination,
+but leads to harmony with the heavens.
+
+Chapter 66
+
+Rivers and seas are rulers
+of the streams of hundreds of valleys
+because of the power of their low position.
+If you want to be the ruler of people,
+you must speak to them like you are their servant.
+If you want to lead other people,
+you must put their interest ahead of your own.
+The people will not feel burdened,
+if a wise person is in a position of power.
+The people will not feel like they are being manipulated,
+if a wise person is in front as their leader.
+The whole world will ask for her guidance,
+and will never get tired of her.
+Because she does not like to compete,
+no one can compete with the things she accomplishes.
+
+Chapter 67
+
+The world talks about honoring the Tao,
+but you can't tell it from their actions.
+Because it is thought of as great,
+the world makes light of it.
+It seems too easy for anyone to use.
+There are three jewels that I cherish:
+compassion, moderation, and humility.
+With compassion, you will be able to be brave,
+With moderation, you will be able to give to others,
+With humility, you will be able to become a great leader.
+To abandon compassion while seeking to be brave,
+or abandoning moderation while being benevolent,
+or abandoning humility while seeking to lead
+will only lead to greater trouble.
+The compassionate warrior will be the winner,
+and if compassion is your defense you will be secure.
+Compassion is the protect
+
+Chapter 68
+
+The best warriors
+do not use violence.
+The best generals
+do not destroy indiscriminately.
+The best tacticians
+try to avoid confrontation.
+The best leaders
+becomes servants of their people.
+This is called the virtue of non-competition.
+This is called the power to manage others.
+This is called attaining harmony with the heavens.
+
+Chapter 69
+
+There is an old saying:
+"It is better to become the passive
+in order to see what will happen.
+It is better to retreat a foot
+than to advance only an inch."
+This is called
+being flexible while advancing,
+pushing back without using force,
+and destroying the enemy without engaging him.
+There is no greater disaster
+than underestimating your enemy.
+Underestimating your enemy
+means loosing your greatest assets.
+When equal forces meet in battle,
+victory will go to the one
+that enters with the greatest sorrow.
+
+Chapter 70
+
+My words are easy to understand
+and easier to put into practice.
+Yet no one in the world seem to understand them,
+and are not able to apply what I teach.
+My teachings come from the ancients,
+the things I do are done for a reason.
+Because you do not know me,
+you are not able to understand my teachings.
+Because those who know me are few,
+my teachings become even more precious.
+
+Chapter 71
+
+Knowing you don't know is wholeness.
+Thinking you know is a disease.
+Only by recognizing that you have an illness
+can you move to seek a cure.
+The Master is whole because
+she sees her illnesses and treats them,
+and thus is able to remain whole.
+
+Chapter 72
+
+When people become overly bold,
+then disaster will soon arrive.
+Do not meddle with peoples livelihood;
+by respecting them they will in turn respect you.
+Therefore, the Master knows herself but is not arrogant.
+She loves herself but also loves others.
+This is how she is able to make appropriate choices.
+
+Chapter 73
+
+Being over bold and confidant is deadly.
+The wise use of caution will keep you alive.
+One is the way to death,
+and the other is the way to preserve your life.
+Who can understand the workings of Heaven?
+The Tao of the universe
+does not compete, yet wins;
+does not speak, yet responds;
+does not command, yet is obeyed;
+and does act, but is good at directing.
+The nets of Heaven are wide,
+but nothing escapes its grasp.
+
+Chapter 74
+
+If you do not fear death,
+then how can it intimidate you?
+If you aren't afraid of dying,
+there is nothing you cannot do.
+Those who harm others
+are like inexperienced boys
+trying to take the place of a great lumberjack.
+Trying to fill his shoes will only get them seriously hurt.
+
+Chapter 75
+
+When people go hungry,
+the governments taxes are too high.
+When people become rebellious,
+the government has become too intrusive.
+When people begin to view death lightly,
+wealthy people have too much
+which causes others to starve.
+Only those who do not cling to their life can save it.
+
+Chapter 76
+
+The living are soft and yielding;
+the dead are rigid and stiff.
+Living plants are flexible and tender;
+the dead are brittle and dry.
+Those who are stiff and rigid
+are the disciples of death.
+Those who are soft and yielding
+are the disciples of life.
+The rigid and stiff will be broken.
+The soft and yielding will overcome.
+
+Chapter 77
+
+The Tao of Heaven works in the world
+like the drawing of a bow.
+The top is bent downward;
+the bottom is bent up.
+The excess is taken from,
+and the deficient is given to.
+The Tao works to use the excess,
+and gives to that which is depleted.
+The way of people is to take from the depleted,
+and give to those who already have an excess.
+Who is able to give to the needy from their excess?
+Only someone who is following the way of the Tao.
+This is why the Master gives
+expecting nothing in return.
+She does not dwell on her past accomplishments,
+and does not glory in any praise.
+
+Chapter 78
+
+Water is the softest and most yielding substance.
+Yet nothing is better than water,
+for overcoming the hard and rigid,
+because nothing can compete with it.
+Everyone knows that the soft and yielding
+overcomes the rigid and hard,
+but few can put this knowledge into practice.
+Therefore the Master says:
+"Only he who is the lowest servant of the kingdom,
+is worthy to become its ruler.
+He who is willing tackle the most unpleasant tasks,
+is the best ruler in the world."
+True sayings seem contradictory.
+
+Chapter 79
+
+Difficulties remain, even after solving a problem.
+How then can we consider that as good?
+Therefore the Master
+does what she knows is right,
+and makes no demands of others.
+A virtuous person will do the right thing,
+and persons with no virtue will take advantage of others.
+The Tao does not choose sides;
+the good person receives from the Tao
+because she is on its side.
+
+Chapter 80
+
+Small countries with few people are best.
+Give them all of the things they want,
+and they will see that they do not need them.
+Teach them that death is a serious thing,
+and to be content to never leave their homes.
+Even though they have plenty
+of horses, wagons and boats,
+they won't feel that they need to use them.
+Even if they have weapons and shields,
+they will keep them out of sight.
+Let people enjoy the simple technologies,
+let them enjoy their food,
+let them make their own clothes,
+let them be content with their own homes,
+and delight in the customs that they cherish.
+Although the next country is close enough
+that they can hear their roosters crowing and dogs barking,
+they are content never to visit each other
+all of the days of their life.
+
+Chapter 81
+
+True words do not sound beautiful;
+beautiful sounding words are not true.
+Wise men don't need to debate;
+men who need to debate are not wise.
+Wise men are not scholars,
+and scholars are not wise.
+The Master desires no possessions.
+Since the things she does are for the people,
+she has more than she needs.
+The more she gives to others,
+the more she has for herself.
+The Tao of Heaven nourishes by not forcing.
+The Tao of the Wise person acts by not competing.
