## Little documentation
This module add ```Equation``` class that allow resolve equation in string
```python
# Create an equation
equation = Equation("2+7*8cos(3)")
# Resolve this equation
equation.result() # 57.92325394625613
```

### Why use ```Equation``` and not ```eval``` ?
- ```Equation``` is faster than ```eval``` (See [tests/main.py](https://github.com/Dhaiven/BetterMaths/blob/main/tests/main.py))
- ```Equation``` support parenthese, mathematical formulas like ```cos``` and magics numbers like ```Ï€```
