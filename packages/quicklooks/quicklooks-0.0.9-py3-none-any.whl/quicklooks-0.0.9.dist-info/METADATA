## Why quicklooks?
Creating attractive, ready-to-share data visualizations takes forever. quickook is a cut-and-paste Python package that does the design work for you and makes it easy to create beautifuly simple data visualizations.

## Who is quicklooks best for?
quicklook is for any data scientist, product manager, or researcher that knows a little bit of Python and is analyzing their data in a Jupyter Notebook. My goal in writing quicklook was to make data viz more efficient, but in the process, I've also created a package that is easy to use for beginners.

## To install...
Directions to come; I am currently overhauling the package and will upload to pip for easy installation.
