To winterize your battery and prevent damage:
 
 1. **For the Li-ion battery**:
  - Avoid storing the vehicle in temperatures below -13째F (-25째C) for more than seven days to prevent the Li-ion battery from freezing.
  - Move the vehicle to a warm location if the outside temperature is -13째F (-25째C) or below, as it may freeze and be unable to charge or power the vehicle.
 
 2. **For the 12-volt battery**:
  - Ensure it is fully charged during extremely cold weather conditions to prevent the battery fluid from freezing and possibly causing damage to the battery.
