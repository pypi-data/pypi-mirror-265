# Configuration for Python test environment manager
# https://tox.wiki/en/latest/user_guide.html
#
# Note that to run `test_nutclient.py` you must prepare a running NUT data
# server (upsd) with a connected driver. You can use a dummy-ups driver for
# that, see e.g. NUT tests/NIT/nit.sh for how the test beds are prepared.
# Further you may need to export `NUT_HOST` and `NUT_PORT` (if not default),
# and a `NUT_USER` and `NUT_PASS` for tests with logged-in session behaviors.
# Then just run `tox` (may have to `pip install tox` first though).
