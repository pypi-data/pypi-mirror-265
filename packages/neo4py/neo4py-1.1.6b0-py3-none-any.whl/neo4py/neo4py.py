    Constructor:
        The constructor of the Graph class takes 2 parameters  - uri and Auth.

        Params:
        uri (str): A string representing a URI to connect to Neo4j database, e.g., bolt://localhost:7687
        Auth (tuple): A tuple containing username and password for authentication against Neo4j Database.

    Run method:
        This is the main method that should be called after creating an instance of this class. It runs a Cypher query on the connected graph database
        to create or read a data from the node in Neo4j.

        Params:
        query (str): It takes a cypher query.
        **kwargs (dict): It takes the data in the dictionary format.

        Return:
        It returns the summary of the  result obtained by executing the query on the database.
