# RoCat: A Simple and User-Friendly Library for AI Services

RoCat is a Python library that provides a simple and user-friendly interface for integrating AI services into your projects.

## Installation

You can install RoCat using pip:

​```
pip install rocat
​```

## Usage

To use RoCat in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules from the RoCat library:

​```
from rocat import ChatbotModule, create_app, run_app
​```

2. Create an instance of the `ChatbotModule` with your OpenAI API key:

​```
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
chatbot = ChatbotModule(api_key)
​```

3. Use the `generate_response` method to generate a response based on a user prompt:

​```
user_prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
response = chatbot.generate_response(user_prompt)
print(response)
​```

4. (Optional) If you want to customize the system prompt for the chatbot, use the `set_system_prompt` method:

​```
chatbot.set_system_prompt("You are a helpful travel assistant.")
​```
