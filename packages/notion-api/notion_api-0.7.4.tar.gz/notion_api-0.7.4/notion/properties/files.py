"""
File objects contain data about a file that is uploaded to Notion, or data about an external file that is linked to in Notion.
Page, embed, image, video, file, pdf, and bookmark block types all contain file objects. 
Icon and cover page object values also contain file objects.

A file with type `file` must contain a Notion hosted file url. Use type `external` for externally hosted files.
