        User objects appear in the API in nearly all objects returned by the API, including:
            - Block object under created_by and last_edited_by.
            - Page object under created_by and last_edited_by and in people property items.
            - Database object under created_by and last_edited_by.
            - Rich text object, as user mentions.
            - Property object when the property is a people property.

        User objects will always contain object and id keys.
        The remaining properties may appear if the user is being rendered in a rich text or
        page property context, and the bot has the correct capabilities to access those properties.

        If your integration doesn't yet have access to the mentioned user,
        then the plain_text that would include a user's name reads as "@Anonymous".
        To update the integration to get access to the user,
        update the integration capabilities on the integration settings page.

        All parameters are display-only and cannot be updated.
