        A filter is a single condition used to specify and limit the entries returned from a database query.
        Database queries can be filtered by page property values.

        Use classmethods:
            - text
            - checkbox
            - number
            - select

            - date
            - people
            - files
            - relation.

        NOTE: You may also filter a database by created_time or last_edited_time,
              even if these aren't present as properties on the database.

        https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-database-query-filter

        Each database property filter object must contain a property key
        and a key corresponding with the type of the database property identified by property.
        The value is an object containing a type-specific filter condition
