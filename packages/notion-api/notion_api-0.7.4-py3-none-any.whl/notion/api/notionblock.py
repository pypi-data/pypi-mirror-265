"""
A block object represents a piece of content within Notion. 
The API translates the headings, toggles, paragraphs, lists, media, and more that you can interact with in the Notion UI as different block type objects.
Block types which support children are:
    "paragraph", "bulleted_list_item", "numbered_list_item", "toggle", "to_do", "quote", "callout",
    "synced_block", "column", "child_page", "child_database", and "table".
    
    All heading blocks ("heading_1", "heading_2", and "heading_3") support children when the is_toggleable property is true.

NOTE: The link_preview block will only be returned as part of a response. It cannot be created via the API.
NOTE: As of March 27, 2023, Notion is no longer supporting the creation of template blocks. They are not included in this module.
NOTE: Column blocks are supported by the API but they are not currently in this module.

    # Factory methods used to create and append new children blocks to the parent block_id specified.
    # Blocks can be parented by other blocks, pages, or databases
    # All methods require a parent instance of either notion.Block or notion.Page
    # By default, blocks are appended to the bottom of the parent block.
    # To append a block in a specific place other than the bottom of the parent block,
    # use the "after" parameter and set its value to the ID of the block that the new block should be appended after.
    # Once a block is appended as a child, it can't be moved elsewhere via the API.

    # Most methods return a `Block` object, which can be used to continously nest blocks.
    # For blocks that allow children, Notion allows up to two levels of nesting in a single request.
    # Each method of `Block` is a separate request to the API and is not affected by this limitation.

    # Some methods return a specialized `Block` object, these include:
    # Codeblock, EquationBlock, TodoBlock, TableBlock, and RichTextBlock.
    # RichTextBlock refers to any block that contains text that can be formatted.
    # These are:  "paragraph", "to_do", "toggle", "quote", "callout"
    #             "bulleted_list_item", "numbered_list_item",
    #             "headings", "toggle_headings"
    # See examples in repo for specific functions for blocks above.

    # Example
    # ```py
    # notion.Block.divider(
    #     notion.Block.paragraph(
    #         notion.Block.paragraph(
    #             notion.Block('87aadab8ce4b407682197c922e51511f'

    #         ), ['This is the child']

        ##### WARNING: embed block types through the API are not reliable and often cause errors.

        Embed block types are:
        Framer, Twitter (tweets), Google Drive documents, Gist, Figma,
        Invision, Loom, Typeform, Codepen, PDFs, Google Maps, Whimisical,
        Miro, Abstract, excalidraw, Sketch, Replit
        There is no need to specify the specific embed type, only the URL.

        ### Differences in embed blocks between the Notion app and the API
        The Notion app uses a 3rd-party service, Embedly, to validate and request metadata for embeds given a URL.
        This works well in a web app because Notion can kick off an asynchronous request for URL information,
        which might take seconds or longer to complete, and then update the block with the metadata in the UI
        after receiving a response from Embedly.

        Embedly is not called when creating embed blocks in the API because the API needs to be able to return
        faster than the UI, and because the response from Embedly could actually cause us change the block type.
        This would result in a slow and potentially confusing experience as the block in the response would
        not match the block sent in the request.
        The result is that embed blocks created via the API may not look exactly
        like their counterparts created in the Notion app.
