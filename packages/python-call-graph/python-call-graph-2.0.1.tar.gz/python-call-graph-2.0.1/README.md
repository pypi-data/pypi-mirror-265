# Python Call Graph

Welcome! Python Call Graph is a [Python](http://www.python.org) module that creates [call graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) visualizations for Python applications.

This repo used to be `pycallgraph` which is still hosted at pypi [link](https://pypi.org/project/pycallgraph/).

The uploader makes no representations of their contribution, and merely wanted this to work in python 3.5; with a goal to porting it to 3.11 and 3.12

## Project Status

The latest version is **2.0.1** which was released on 2024-03-31, and is a backwards incompatible from the previous release, dropped 2.7 support and is targetting the quite old Python 3.5.

The [project lives on GitHub](https://github.com/lewiscowles1986/py-call-graph/#python-call-graph), where you can [report issues](https://github.com/lewiscowles1986/py-call-graph/issues), contribute to the project by [forking the project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) then creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests), or just [browse the source code](https://github.com/lewiscowles1986/py-call-graph/).

The documentation needs some work stiil. Feel free to contribute :smile:

## Features

* Support for Python 3.5.
* Static visualizations of the call graph using various tools such as Graphviz and Gephi.
* Execute pycallgraph from the command line or import it in your code.
* Customisable colors. You can programatically set the colors based on number of calls, time taken, memory usage, etc.
* Modules can be visually grouped together.
* Easily extendable to create your own output formats.

## Quick Start

Installation is easy as

```shell
pip install pycallgraph

```

You can either use the [command-line interface](https://pycallgraph.readthedocs.io/en/develop/guide/command_line_usage.html) for a quick visualization of your Python script, or the [pycallgraph module](https://pycallgraph.readthedocs.io/en/develop/api/pycallgraph.html) for more fine-grained settings.

The following examples specify graphviz as the outputter, so it's required to be installed. They will generate a file called `pycallgraph.png`.

The command-line method of running pycallgraph is::

```shell
pycallgraph graphviz -- ./mypythonscript.py

```

A simple use of the API is::

```python
from pycallgraph import PyCallGraph
from pycallgraph.output import GraphvizOutput

with PyCallGraph(output=GraphvizOutput()):
    code_to_profile()

```
