# Python Cli Pride Flags

🏳️‍🌈 Pride flags in your Terminal powerd by python.

This Project was inspired by [cli-pride-flags](https://github.com/ExperiBass/cli-pride-flags) and [prideful](https://github.com/angelofallars/prideful). I just wanted to see how to create cli apps.

Everything is written in python flags are stored in flags.py, you can easily add your own flags.
