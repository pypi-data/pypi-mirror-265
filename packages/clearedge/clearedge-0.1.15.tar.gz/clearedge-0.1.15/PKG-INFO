Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

## Overview
Clearedge is a Python package designed to simplify the process of extracting raw text and metadata from documents. You can use it to retrieve not only the text but also valuable metadata including titles, subheadings, page numbers, file names, bounding box (bbox) coordinates, and chunk types. Whether you're working on document analysis, data extraction projects, or building a RAG app with LLM, Clearedge provides a straightforward and efficient solution.


## Features

- Text Extraction: Extract raw text from documents (currently supports pdf only. other file types coming soon).
- Metadata Retrieval: Obtain metadata such as subheadings, page numbers, file names, bounding boxes and more.
- Bounding Box Coordinates: Access bbox coordinates for text chunks, enabling spatial analysis of text placement within documents.
- Chunk Type Identification: Identify types of text chunks (e.g., table, text and more) for advanced content analysis.
- Support for Multiple Formats (coming soon): Compatible with popular document formats, ensuring broad usability.

## Installation

To install clearedge, you will need Python 3.9 or later. Installation is easy using pip:

```bash
pip install clearedge
```

## Quick Start
Here's a simple example to get you started with clearedge:
```python
from clearedge.reader.pdf import process_pdf

# Call the extractor with the path to your document
chunks = process_pdf('/path/to/your/document.pdf', use_ocr=True) # do not add use_ocr for faster processing. output is less accurate without ocr. 

# Extract text and metadata
for chunk in chunks:
    text, metadata = chunk.text, chunk.metadata
    print(text) # Accessing extracted text
    print(metadata.to_dict()) # Accessing metadata
```
