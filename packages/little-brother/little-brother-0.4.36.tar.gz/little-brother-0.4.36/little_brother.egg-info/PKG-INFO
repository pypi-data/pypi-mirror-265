Tool to monitor login time of users on Debian hosts and terminate processes if usage times are exceeded. Note that this package is not meant as a simple install with PIP since it also requires additional work in the operating system (e.g. add a user, create directories, define a startup service). This is all done by the Debian package provided at https://sourceforge.net/projects/little-brother/ .
