## What is Brawser?

The simplest browser opener with AWS management console from the command line interface.

By running this CLI command, you can open the console soon with your AWS account and the IAM role/user that you are using.

Note: the spelling of this tool is not br "o" wser, but br "aws" er.


## How Brawser works?
The following steps are executed inside the Brawser.

1. Initialize a new session using the Boto3 library.
2. Prepare for session data.
3. Request a sign-in token.
4. Generate the federated URL.
5. Open your default browser with the URL

## Prerequisite

- The IAM role/user which Brawser use with has the `GetSessionToken` priviledge at least. 
- The URL is open with any default browser like Google Chrome, Safari or Edge. So any installed browser is needed.
